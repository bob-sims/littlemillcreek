Lon was born 25 Mar 1896, the fourth child and second son of Calvin and Ophelia Smith Nixon.  He was born in Jasper Co. where his mother's parents lived.

At age 14, the 1910 census reports that he worked as a laborer at the planer mill with his Dad and 16 year old brother Eugene.

In 1915 he worked at Mr. Fox's sawmill in Moselle in Jones Co.  He and Eugene drove 5 miles in a horse and buggy to get to work.  His young nephew, Victor, remembers raiding their lunch buckets on their way home for leftovers.

On Sundays he polished his shoes until they really shined.  First they were coated with a quick-drying liquid dye from a bottle.  After it dryed, wax paste from a small tin was applied.  Shinola was one brand of polish.

As an adult Lon was a small man.  He weighed about 140 lbs.  He had black hair and skin tanned from working outdoors.  His niece, Grace described him as "lovable".

He always smoked.  He made his own cigarettes.  Scarce money prevented people from buying cigarettes.  Smoking creased and wrinkled his skin as he aged.

He had a weakness for whiskey.  Occasionally he drank too much.  He would go for years without drinking and then have a bout with the bottle.

About 1916 he married Ethel Walters (b. March 1903) at Rhodes, MS.  She was the oldest child of Ada Gunter Walters and Mr. Walters.  Her dad was killed in an accident when she was a young child.  They lived at first with Lon's parents.

The 1920 census recorded them in Calvin & Ophelia's household.  Lon is described as a teamster who worked hauling.  Initially he used mules and a wagon to haul logs to Mr. Conway Bradley's mill in Moselle.

In 1923 he bought a Ford truck.

He hauled gravel for new road construction or to gravel an old dirt road.  He built a dump body a new Ford truck.  He secured two 3" x 10" 's edgewise anchored by "U" bolts to the truck frame with crosspieces at the front and back to form a frame.  He built a wooden box that would hold about one yard that fitted just inside his frame timbers.  This box pivoted around an iron pipe just behind the rear axle with most of it projecting behind.  A ring behind the cab held the body horizontal.  By removing it, the body tipped backwards emptying the load.  He was paid by the load.  

In about 1924 he had an accident.  In an open truck Lon and Victor were moving at about 3 mph down a hill with their backs leaning against the logs.  About 24" in diameter, the logs were about 18' long.  Three logs rested on the trailer frame and two rode atop those.  When the weight of the logs and trailer pressed against the bolster pin, it bent.  That allowed the logs to shift forward pushing Lon into the steering wheel.  The steering wheel also bent forward.  Victor had jumped off.  Lon was able to squeeze out to one side.  Although he was injured, he could talk.  Victor dragged him to the side of the road.  Then he returned to where the logs were loaded to get help.  After a delay, Mr. Sanderson there brought his car and carried Lon to Dr. Carter in Ellisville.

After several weeks he recovered.  He repaired his truck and anchored the coupling pole to protect the bolster pin.
 
Later he owned 2 or 3 trucks and hired drivers to work for him.  Robert Beeson, an alcoholic, drove for him.

Over the next years they moved many times, living whereever work was available.

About 1932 Ethel had a stillborn child.  It was the only child they ever had.

In 1943 they rented a house near the woolen mill north of Pascagoula.  Lon worked as a carpenter for contractors.

In 1947 they lived in Victor and Inez's house on Williams St. in Pascagoula.

About 1948 they bought 40 acres of land SE of Lucedale north of highway 613.  Lon built a nice five room, two bedroom house with a bath.  It featured red shutters with a front and back porch.  His nephew Bruce helped with the building; his nephew Victor wired the house.  Lon fenced the property and built a solid barn and a wash house.  Later he bought 10 additional acres in front of his house.

In their living room they had a floor model radio and a large tv set.

When asked why did you move to George County away from the coast, he replied, "Son, I wanted to get away from the damn vines!"

For about 3 years Lon grew watermelons.  One year he raised both red and yellow-meated melons.  No insecticide was required.  Truckers would stop at his place and buy loads of melons to haul away to sell.  With an average melon weighing 35 lbs. trucks could carry from 200 to 500 melons depending on the size of the truck. 
 
He kept about 20 head of cattle.  To make them easier to handle, he dehorned them.  He electrified a fence to prevent the livestock damaging the fence.  He frequented the Lucedale stockyard where auctions were a weekly event.

About 1954 he bought a corner grocery and meat market.  They first rented and then sold the farm south of town.  Ernest Hollingshead had operated the store.  Nixon's grocery prospered.  He sold gasoline, soft drinks, groceries, and especially fresh meat.

About 1957 they sold the store and moved to a 5-10 acre place south of Lucedale.
 
Lon died suddenly of a heart attack in July 1959.  He was in Pascagoula to visit his hospitalized sister Idell Nixon Sims.  At her house he collapsed and died.  (Idell died about 10 days later unaware that he was gone.)  He was buried at the Lucedale cemetery.
