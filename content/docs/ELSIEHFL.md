Born October 5, 1913 at the family farm north of Vancleave, MS, Elsie was the ninth child and fifth daughter of Dora and Bill Havens.

While fishing her brother Ira found an alligator nest full of eggs.  He brought the eggs home and buried them at the end of the field.  When the young gators hatched, he put them in a # 3 wash tub.  For devilment Elsie released them.  She was chastised when her mother forced her to put them back.

The children drove themselves to school in a double-seated surrey.  They would sing on the way.  Among other songs, they sang, "Ole Black Joe".  Harmon would unhitch the horse at the school house and put it in a shed there.

From her first years in school Elsie remembers that Mr. Humphrey would ring the bell and students from grades 1 to 12 marched into the auditorium for "chapel".  Chapel began with singing one or two songs and concluded with a prayer, sometimes the Lord's prayer.  Then they had a 10 minute recess.

In 1925 Elsie broke her right arm at the wrist.  At school four children were playing on each end of a see-saw.  When the ones on the opposite end jumped off, Elsie fell and was hurt.  Dr. Ratliff set the bone, but it didn't stay set.  It healed with a swelling at her wrist.  Of the 10 children, remarkably this was the only broken bone in the family!

Her earliest memories of Christmas date from about this time.  The family cut a pine tree for their Christmas tree.  It was decorated with strung popcorn, paper chains and a rope of silver tinsel.  Typically each child received one gift, not because they were impoverished, but because that was the custom of that time.  Their presents were wrapped in colorful paper.  Although the family did not send Christmas cards, they did receive some.  Elsie collected their early cards in a scrapbook.

Both Elsie and her older sister, Maye, learned to play the organ in the living room.  Elsie's teachers were: Miss Butcher at school, Mrs. Clyde Gunn, and Mrs. Annie May Lockard at home.  Elsie attributes musical talent to the Roberts side of the family. (Her grandmother Havens was Mary Jane Roberts.) 

The family had a wind-up victrola.  Made of walnut and standing 40 inches high, it played flat records.   Elsie remembers that the song would be over before you finished winding it!  They had a recording of "I'm praying for you".  Originally the victrola belonged to Aunt Nora.  After her death, their Grandma Seymour gave it to them.

For several years Elsie made syrup for her Dad.  In good years they made 200 gallons or more.  It took a week to cook that much juice.

A horse pulled a pole in a circle to power the sugar cane mill that squeezed the juice from the cane.  From a drum the juice flowed in a galvanized pipe to the cooking pan.  A cork allowed the syrup maker to regulate when juice entered the pan.  The pan included four sections made of galvanized iron, followed by four made of copper.  Gates could be raised or lowered to allow the juice to flow to the next section.  The pan rested on a brick firebox.  Lighterd (lightwood) was burned to cook the syrup.  The syrup-maker skimmed foam from the syrup and slung it into a pit on one side.  The hogs loved it.

After about 2 hours of cooking the syrup was ready.  Bursting bubbles on the surface signaled that it was done.  The hot syrup was transferred into a #3 galvanized washtub covered with cheesecloth to remove any foreign matter.  Working quickly with a dipper the cans were filled with hot syrup.

The clean, new syrup cans were bought from C. L. Dees store.  In about 1930 they cost 5 cents or 10 cents apiece.  That was considered high.  Now (in 1995) they cost $1.00 each!

The Dees store was originally the Dantzler Commissary for road builders.  It was located on the East side of Hwy. 57.  About 1927 Dees took it over and moved it to the West side of the highway.

Syrup-making occurred in hot weather in September.  The heat from the fire-box made it even hotter.  Honeybees loved the sweet juice and syrup.  They were a nuisance.

Elsie graduated from Vancleave High School in late May 1934.  There were 21 in her class.  The girls wore long white dresses and carried bouquets of flowers.  While most fabric sold for $.06 to $.08 per yard, white silk crepe from Sears & Roebuck sold for $.50 a yard.  Because her Dad didn't have money on hand, he borrowed $1.50 from Aunt Lil to order the material.  Elsie made her dress using her mother's peddle Singer sewing machine.  The class flowers were pink and blue larkspurs.  Elsie carried a bouquet of larkspurs that she grew.

Graduates did not mail announcements.  They were given bouquets of flowers and presents as gifts.  Roscoe Fletcher gave her a miniature cedar chest filled with stationary.

That same year she enrolled at Mobile City Hospital for training to become a registered nurse.  In high school she had completed two first aid courses and passed a state test on emergency care.  She quit nursing school to get married.

On Sunday Sept. 30, 1934 she married Andrew Roscoe Fletcher.  Roscoe (b. August 6, 1913) was the son of Jeptha Jehu Fletcher (b. 1868) and Phoebe Manning Fletcher.  The "Moss Point Advertizer" newspaper said, "Mrs. Fletcher is the attractive daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. R. Havens.  She has recently been employed in the Mobile City Hospital...The many friends of the young couple wish them much happiness in their married life."

They moved into their home on Old River Rd. north of Vancleave in 1934.  Jehu's mother Susan (b. 1851; d. 1933) had given him the land that she had inherited and money to build a house.  In 1911 Earl, Howard and Cliff Davis built until the money ran out.  When Roscoe and Elsie moved in the upstairs was unfinished and the first floor rooms were not sealed.  Over the years they worked to finish the upstairs and panel the first floor rooms.

About 1934 they got a GE battery radio.  REA did not supply electricity to that area until 1941.

In 1935 Roscoe and Elsie made cypress shingles (boards) to roof their barn.

Elsie and Roscoe had the following children: 

1) Elsie Jeanne Fletcher (b. Dec. 11, 1935; md. 1) Wilton Holden, 2) Bill Blount). 
2) John Andrew Fletcher (b. Dec. 12, 1941; md. Carolyn Newell). 
3) Arie Christina Fletcher (b. May 28, 1943; md. William Swift). 
4) Roscoe Havens Fletcher (b. May 10, 1948; md. Virginia "Ginger" O'Neal).

Roscoe's mother Phoebe had a debilitating stroke.  They cared for her.  After her death, they cared for Mr. Fletcher until his death.

Beginning about 1939 Roscoe worked for Ingall's shipyard (later Litton) in Pascagoula.  Thus he drove about 35 miles each way to work.  He was a shipfitter and supervisor of shipfitters.  He was employed there 29 1/2 years.

In 1943 Elsie carried her ailing Dad and her babies in an old Ford car to Dr. McCloud in Wiggins.  Roscoe had bought the car for $50.  It didn't have a muffler.  The dirt roads were deeply rutted, but they made it.  Dr. McCloud gave Bill some medicine.

After they finished high school, graduates could take a 6 week course to train teachers.  Elsie's sister, Annie Havens Walker, took this course and began teaching.  In about 1950 Elsie recommended to Annie that she get a college degree.  She did.  Her picture appeared in the newspapers when she graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in the same ceremony as her son John Lewis Walker.

From her childhood every October the family attended the New Prospect Methodist Campground east of highway 57 in Northern Jackson Co.  In 1951 after a fire at the campground destroyed some tents, they built a tent where part of the Tootle tent had been.  All the land there belongs to the campground.  Roscoe, Dan Fletcher, and Larry McMillan, with help from John and Havens, built the tent.  Originally it had a packed dirt floor covered with pine straw and a wood stove for heat and cooking.

About 1955 they added on the north side and the west side, widening the kitchen, and adding 2 bedrooms a bath and shower.  They now have 4 bedrooms.  When they could no longer get pine straw, they poured a concrete floor.  Will Fletcher, Roscoe's third cousin, built and varnished the heavy pine table.

In 1995 tent owners (52 families) pay $35 a year for electricity.  They receive water from a common well and plumbing system.  They maintain individual septic systems.

Elsie and Roscoe and their family move to the campground to live for 10 days a year.  They move on Friday before the second Sunday in October.  A school bus collects children daily from the campground to take them to school.  An invited Methodist minister delivers sermons throughout the week.  Elsie, Roscoe and their great granddaughter Skila Fletcher were all baptized there.  Many activities are planned throughout the week for families and children.  They have a hay ride, a bonfire, a children's parade, an olympic games, etc.  Campmeeting provides a fine opportunity for family reunions.
 
In 1951 they bought their first tractor, a John Deere.  In 1993, Elsie sold it for more than they paid for it!

In 1959 friends and relatives hosted a 25th wedding anniversary celebration party for Roscoe and Elsie.  Friends came from near and far.  Among the gifts, they received a set of silver-plated grapefruit spoons.

Roscoe died July 18, 1969 and is buried at Red Hill Cemetery.
