Waldo was born May 20, 1880 the sixth child and second son of Robert and Elizabeth Campbell Sims.  He was born in Choctaw Co., AL.

In the Summer of about 1887 Bob had an entire crib of corn stored from the previous fall's harvest, not needed for livestock food through the winter and now weevil damaged.  He gave Waldo the job of chopping up ears for Brennus, an ox.  Waldo supplied a trough of corn and water for Brennus through the Summer to fatten him.  After eating to his heart's content that entire crib of corn, Brennus was slaughtered.  He dressed over 200 lbs to the quarter, a giant.  Leather strings from his shanks were used to retie the cowhide bottoms in two old oak chairs now owned by Hugo and Glenda Sims.

He grew up in a family of readers.  As a consequence he read widely from the works of Victor Hugo, Voltaire, Tolstoi, Shakespeare's plays, Jack London and Mark Twain.

As a boy he memorized "The Chase" from Sir Walter Scott's "Lady of the Lake".

After the tragic deaths of his father and older brother, Bailey in 1891, Waldo became at age 11 the oldest male in the family.  The family moved to eastern Mississippi.  They lived in several small communities: Stonewall, Winchester.

There Waldo and the older children worked in cotton mills.  Each mill operated 10-12 hours a day year round making bolts of cloth from bales of cotton.  The cotton was spun into thread and the threads woven on looms into fabric.  Each mill typically ran 100 or more looms, making a constant din of noise.  Waldo was responsible for 20 to 25 looms.  He carried a tool similar to a pair of pliers for reattaching broken threads.  He constantly walked around the looms monitoring them.  He was paid less than a dollar a day.

As a young adult he had curly brown hair and weighed about 175 lbs.  By 1918 his hair had turned snow white.  In all our photographs he has pure white curly hair.

About 1900 he traveled to Estabutchie in Jones Co. where he got a job at a sawmill for $1 a day.  He found a house for the family to buy.  After 100 days of work there he paid the owner of the house $100 as a first payment for it!  The total price was $250 for the house plus 40 acres of land.

He worked at the Eastman Gardner sawmill there from 1900 to 1910.  He graded lumber as it came from the planeing machine.  Grades 1, 2, and 3 each had several subdivisions.

On 27 Sept 1905 Waldo married Etta Idell Nixon (b. 9 Dec 1888), daughter of Calvin and Aura Smith Nixon.  A spirited horse, Dan pulled the buggy through high water and mud to carry them to Hattiesburg.  Crossing the Leaf River the water was up to Dan's belly!  After the judge performed the ceremony, they spent the night with Waldo's sister Cookie Norwood and her husband.

They lived in an apartment in Estabutchie in the old Bonner store.  There on 10 July 1906 their first child, Robert Bruce was born.  Dr. Gardner delivered Bruce and the other children as well.

About 1907 they moved into a white frame house with red trim and a tin roof.  With a front porch across the south side, it had two large front rooms and an "L" on the back.  This house still stands today (1996) in Estabutchie.  There on 22 Sept 1908 Victor Hugo was born; on 10 May 1910 Grace was born.

In 1910 Waldo operated his first cotton gin at Estabutchie, MS.  He bought it from Cicero Thatch and cleaned it up. It had only 1 gin stand.  After only one year of operation in 1911 it burned down.  Lint makes a gin vulnerable to fire, but there was a suspicion that arson caused this loss.

About 1911 Waldo moved the family to Carson in Jeff Davis County.  There he operated the gin one season for the Meridian Fertilizer Co.  The Meridian Fertilizer Co. folks quickly recognized Waldo's ability to keep the gin running efficiently, to produce satisfied customers and to handle money responsibly.  As evidence of this they established a bank account in his name.

About 1912 the family returned to Jones Co. living in Moselle.  After rebuilding the gin there, he operated it for 4 or 5 years.

Farmers packed about 1500 lbs. of cotton on their wagons.  At the gin the loaded wagon was weighed.  Later the weight of the empty wagon was subtracted to give the total weight of the seed cotton.  After the bale was weighed by subtracting its weight from the seed cotton weight, the weight of the seed was obtained.  Typically the bale weighed about 500 lb and the seed about 1000 lbs.

All the ginning machinery was upstairs at the gin.  A 10-12" telescoping metal suction hose lifted the cotton from the wagon to the gin stand hopper or feeder.  About 20 minutes was required to empty the wagon.  The suction fluffed the cotton and much of the trash fell out.

The gin stand measured about 4' x 5' x 4' with cast iron ends and the feeder on top.  In the gin stand a whirling roller covered with curved hooks flung the cotton at whirling saws.  Again trash fell out.  Each gin stand had one mandrell (shaft) about 5 feet long with 80 12" saws about 3/4" apart with curved teeth.  Cast iron ribs stood between the saws with about 1/8" clearance, allowing the fiber, but not the seeds, to pass through.  The saws turned at 500 rpm cutting the cotton away from the seed and pulling the fibers between the ribs of the breast works.  A roll of cotton formed between the saws and the breast on the opposite side.  A brush, a solid cylinder covered with rows of hog or horse bristles in horizontal strips, turned at 1500 rpm.  It combed the cotton.  (Later the brush was replaced by a fan with a nozzle.)  The seed fell between the saws and the breast; the cotton fell between the saws and the brush roll.  Ginning removed 100% of the seed from the fiber producing lint cotton. 

A large pipe behind the stand carried the cotton to the condenser with a 6' diameter and 6' long roller of hardware cloth.  It filtered the cotton from the air that carried it along.  An exhaust pipe allowed hot air to escape through the roof.  A small wooden roller transferred the pad of cotton from the condenser to the press.  

The press box measured 10' high by 5' by 3 1/2' and was built of heavy 2" thick lumber.  While cotton was feeding into the press, a man worked there with a preliminary packer.   When that box was filled, a 16' circle in the floor rotated to the opposite side where an empty press could be filled.  Then a steam-powered block beneath the first press box packed the cotton upwards tightly.  Burlap on the top and floor of the empty box enclosed the bale.  After the hydraulic system was turned off, the box broke apart.  After the sides were let down,  6 steel ties were buckled outside the burlap.

The bale was rolled onto the scales.  Using a can of lampblack and kerosene the initials of the owner and the number of that bale for that year were marked on the burlap.  The entire ginning process took about 30 minutes per bale.   

Later in Seminary they operated two complete gins in one building.  Each had three 80-saw gin stands.  In late September one year on their most productive day ever, they ginned 90 bales of cotton during daylight!

In 1913 the first window screen appeared.  Waldo bought galvanized screen for the Moselle house.

Waldo bought several Success pecan trees from Bass Nurseries in Lumberton, MS that he planted in their yard in Moselle.

In 1917 Waldo bought the family's first automobile, a 1916 Model T Ford touring car.  Black with a black interior, it had a cloth top and curtains to keep out rain.  It had a brass radiator.  A hand crank started the four cylinder engine.  It ran 20 miles on a gallon of gasoline.  Waldo overhauled it.

Several months later he bought a 1911 Hupmobile from an Indiana soldier who was about to be shipped out for military duty.  Waldo paid $225 for it.  It featured leather upholstery.  Later a kid stole it and went for a joy ride and wrecked it.

After a law passed limiting the ownership of cottonseed oil companies to one gin in their hometown, the Meridian Fertilizer Co. financed Waldo's purchases of the gins at Sanford, Ellisville, Moselle and Seminary.  About 1920 the family moved to Seminary to operate 4 gins.

In about 1920 Waldo took the family to a performance by a professional acting troop at the Strand Theater in Hattiesburg.  They enjoyed the "Trail of the Lonesome Pine" by John Fox.  At $3 for adults, the tickets were very expensive.  

That same year the family took in a young orphan girl, Nancy Sasser (b. Mar 1916).  Although she was never legally adopted, she was raised by the family.  They called her Margaret, so she was known as Margaret Sims.

In 1921 a lawsuit involving the grist mill forced it to be padlocked.  Farmers appealed to Waldo for help.  They needed cornmeal to cook with.  A pair of mill stones had been abandoned at the gin.  A nest of rats lived in them.  Victor's dog, Chip, loved to kill rats.  He grabbed their heads in his jaws and crushed their skulls.  As the rats were chased out, Victor held Chip beside the mill stones and he killed nine rats!  They cleaned the stones up and began grinding corn on Saturdays.  Only 40-50 lbs of steam pressure was required.  The miller kept about 1/7 of the corn that he ground for pay.  Their corn was poured into the toll box.  It measured 4' x 4' x 4'.  Every Saturday it was filled up. It was profitable.

When the other grist mill reopened, they closed theirs.

Cotton farmers around Seminary grew a lot of cotton allowing the gins there to flourish.  Waldo's and a competitor's gins produced 4000 bales a year.  Waldo ginned about 2900 of those.  George Thames worked for him as a bookkeeper.  

During the summer of 1925 when he weighed about 225 lbs., he suffered a ruptured appendix.  The pain began while he, Idell and Grace were visiting his mother.  The pain became severe.  He knew it was his appendix.  He said it was like a picture of a sunburst when it burst.  Dr. Carr visited him.  After 2 or 3 days of resting in bed, when he felt better, they moved him home.  He never had surgery!

Waldo's best friends were Mr. Charlie Baylis at Estabutchie, Mr. John Praytor at Moselle.  He enjoyed talking with them about books and ideas.

In 1928 electricity came to Seminary.  Bruce and Waldo helped Mr. Blau of MS Power Co. with the wiring.  They electrified their water pump using a 3/4 horse motor, a switch and a 2" pulley.  The pump was protected by a metal box.  They installed a 2500 gallon steel water tank.  Immediately the family bought an electric iron and an oscillating fan.  Later they bought a toaster and a hot plate.

About 1929 Waldo bought their first radio, an AC Dayton, from Virgil Strahan in Collins.  Two batteries, an A battery (an automobile battery) and a B battery powered it.  The batteries could be recharged.  The speaker was in a separate box with a 15" diameter horn.  About a 60' outside wire served as an aerial.  Early radio stations broadcast from Laurel and Hattiesburg.  They also picked up stations in Gulfport and Nashville, TN.

He began smoking about 1929.  He rolled his own cigarettes and 
smoked about 6 a day.

With his sons grown, Waldo did not want to tackle the work of running a gin alone.  Bearings frequently wore out; belts had to be relaced.  Selling the gins netted little profit, as they were financed.

In 1931 Waldo moved the family to Hattiesburg.  They lived in a nice 2-story white clapboard house on Second Street.  It had seven rooms with 12' ceilings, wallpapered walls and pine floors.  It was connected to city water and electricity; it had a gas stove and an indoor toilet, the first one for the family!

Victor electrified his mother's peddle-operated Singer sewing machine.

Waldo moved his family to an old water mill site in rural northern Jackson Co.  The family moved in James McCaffrey's flat-bed Chevrolet 1 1/2 ton truck. (He used it in his grocery business in Hattiesburg.)  After moving household goods they made several later trips.  They hauled 40-60 bushels of shelled corn and 50 bushels of sweet potatoes that Victor had grown that year in Uncle Solie's field at Estabutchie.  They hauled two milk cows that Bruce had bought.

This was during the worst of the depression.  Folks didn't have any money.  There was no money for clothing; there was no money for gasoline.

Waldo took over gardening from Idell.  That first Fall at Vancleave after Victor had plowed the 1/2 acre garden, Waldo planted rows of greens, mustard, turnips and rape (Rape could withstand freezing).  He planted onion sets.  Later they hoed the rows to remove weeds. 

The next Spring he planted red irish potatoes, corn and beans.  At first they selected field corn.  Later they planted Tennessee red cob and Hasting's prolific corn.

Living in a river swamp rich in game, he began animal trapping.  He bought about 2 dozen steel traps from young Eudell Goff and a trapping license from the state.  Using bits of bird flesh and fluids as bait, he set the traps in animal trails near water.  Trapping was done in winter to avoid the reproductive seasons of the game.  He caught minks, raccoons and a few otters.  Mink invariably drowned.  He caught about 10 - 12 a year.  Their skins sold for $7-10 each.  

He caught five times as many coons, but their skins brought only $2 each.  The state Fish & Game Commission paid trappers to keep female raccoons alive and release them at the end of the season.  Bruce had built an incubator from hardware cloth for biddies (young chicks).  Waldo used it to hold female coons.  The commission paid $2.50-$3.00 for each female.  He caught an unusual black male coon.  They kept it in the cage with the females and released it.

All the skins were mailed to Sears, the purchaser.  Because you could not sell otter skins in MS, but you could in LA, he mailed those he caught to his nephew, Joe Norwood, in New Orleans who sold them to Sears for him.  They sold for $12 each. 

Waldo learned swamp landmarks by walking through the swamp.  At that time the best roads were graveled.  In 1932 workers were graveling highway 57 north to Broome School.

He began having persistent pains in his side.  He walked to try to get relief.  Later Dr. William Wetherford treated him and admitted him to the Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula.  After six weeks there, sadly, on 31 May 1946 Waldo died of cancer.  His death certificate records the cause of death as carcinoma of the stomach.  (This might have been triggered by toxins that entered his body when his appendix ruptured.)

He is buried at Machpelah Cemetery in Pascagoula, MS.
