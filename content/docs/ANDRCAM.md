Andrew was the third child and second son of Joseph Lawrence Campbell and Isadore Moseley Campbell (b. 1859).  He was born Jan 6, 1882 in Choctaw Co., AL.  His grandparents were: Elias and Annice Pearson Campbell, and Benjamin (b. 1831) and Mary Ann Moseley (b. 1836).

When Andrew was six he became ill with malaria.  For Dr. Bruister to treat him, he lived for about a year with the doctor.  His illness prevented his attending school for a while.  Evenso he developed a fine vocabulary.  Later the family moved to reduce the risk of infection from mosquitoes.

Andrew learned to play the violin.  With his brothers he provided music for community dances.  He frequently played "Cotton-Eyed Joe".

On Dec 4, 1907, at the Ft. Bayou community in Jackson Co, MS he married Vertie Lee Mallett.  Born July 28, 1887, she was the daughter of George L. and Cynthia Gill Mallett. 

They lived first in the Campbell house in Woolmarket.

Vertie Lee and Andrew had the following children:

1. Ina Florence Campbell (b. 19 Sept 1908; d. 12 Apr 1992)(18 May 1927 md. Charles Wm. Rushing; had 3 boys and 1 girl).
2. Ruby Merrell "Merle" Campbell (b. 6 Jan 1910; d. 22 Feb 1958)(1929 md. Clifford J. Davis; had 2 boys and 1 girl).
3. Lola Helen Campbell (b. 29 Feb 1912; d. 18 Aug 1917 of malaria).
4. Claude Louis Campbell (b. 1 May 1914)(md. Hilda C. Foil; two children).
5. Lloyd Wallace Campbell (b. 18 Aug 1916; d. 20 Dec 1976)(md. Martina Harvey; had a daughter; divorced).	
6. Zelma Leo & Velma Cleo Campbell, twins (b. 14 July 1919; Cleo died 22 May 1921; Leo md. 1) Paul A. Richardson; had 1 daughter; 2) Lod Messer; divorced).
8. Donald Ray Campbell (b. 21 Jan 1923) (11 Aug 1946 md. Kathryn Olena Davis; had 4 children).
9. Jean Marilyn Campbell (b. 19 Nov 1925; md. 1) David Mooney Wier; divorced ; 28 June 1975 md. 2) Joe Brown (b. 1923; d. 15 Sept 1990).

From his prolonged contact with the doctor as he was growing up, he had learned to assist at childbirth.  He helped Vertie Lee with the delivery of all their older children.  Only Jean was born at the hospital.

For several years Andrew worked at the Dantzler Lumber Co. sawmill.  He judged the boards to be cut from the timbers. 

About 1919 the family moved to the Cedar Lake community.  When the Cedar Lake bridge tender was away, Andrew would occasionally operate the bridge.  It was opened by pushing a turnstile in a circle.  Once when he opened the bridge, a barge hit the bridge footing.  Andrew later appeared in court as a witness about this incident.

Andrew farmed.  He plowed about 10 to 15 acres with his horse.  As the result of hard work, he produced good crops.

The family moved several times over the years as they farmed in D'Iberville and Ft. Bayou.  For a time they lived in an old schoolhouse.

Vertie Lee's father George failed to pay taxes on timber land he had cut.  He encouraged his children to pay taxes on it and redeem it for themselves.  Andrew & Vertie Lee redeemed 40 acres of this land.

About 1935 Andrew built a new home for his family on their land.  Her brother George E. Mallett operated a sawmill.  They got lumber from him.  First they had a shallow well with a pitcher pump.  Later they put down a deep well.

Mr. Minor Nobles at the papermill remarked, that he had never heard an intelligent prayer prayed in his life until a man named Andrew Campbell moved into the community.

In 1967 their children arranged a 60th wedding anniversary celebration for Andrew and Vertie Lee.  Leo told the women who had come to clean the house, "Don't tell anyone about the state of this house.  They wouldn't believe you, if you did!"  They had a fine party.

As he aged he developed arteriosclerosis.  Sadly, Andrew died at 1:45 am July 12, 1969 in Hattiesburg, MS at the Hattiesburg Convalescent Center.  He's buried at the Coalville Cemetery in Woolmarket in Harrison Co., MS.

After several years Vertie Lee became feeble.  She moved to the Plaza Nursing Home between Pascagoula and Moss Point.  She shared a room there with her sister-in-law Ophelia Campbell.  She sewed aprons and bonnets from pretty colored fabric and sold them.  The family never told her that the fabric cost more than her prices yielded!

Vertie Lee died June 23, 1978.  She's buried beside Andrew.
