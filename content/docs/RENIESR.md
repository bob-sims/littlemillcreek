Renie was the daughter of Jim Sims (b. 1850) and Betty Bazoon Sims (b. Nov 15, 1862; d. Nov 7, 1943).  She was born in November 1883 in Choctaw County AL.

On Dec 10, 1898 Renie married Henry Oliver Rogers (b. May 1880) in Wayne Co. MS.  

Oliver was the son of John? (or A. H. (b. 1830)) Rogers and Mary Ann Murphy Rogers (b. 1850).  They had three boys: Oliver, Sam and Emory.  Sam, a scoundrel, married Betty Bazoon Sims following Jim Sims's death in 1891.

Renie and Oliver had just one child, a daughter, Olive born in November 1899.

In the 1900 census of Choctaw Co., Oliver was described as a farmer.  They owned a farm that was mortgaged.  Olive was seven months old.

After a few years Renie and Oliver moved to Hattiesburg, MS.  They lived at the end of seventh street in a nice 3 bedroom "L" shaped frame house.  It had 10' ceilings and a large backyard.  

Oliver contracted to haul goods for businesses.  He kept four large horses and mules to pull his wagon.  He hauled building materials, sand, gravel, brick, etc.  He made a horse lot in their backyard and had sheds there.  He took good care of his horses.

Renie was a good housekeeper.  She kept their home neat and clean.

The family was very active in the Seventh Day Adventist Church.  Waldo Sims would tease his cousin about going to church on Saturday.

On one occasion when Waldo was justly criticizing Sam Rogers, Renie said, "Waldo, please let ole Sam's bones rest!"

Olive took music lessons and studied music at State Teachers College (now USM).  She married:

1. Denham Batson, son of the mayor of Hattiesburg.  Because he drank, they divorced.

2. Brad Braley, a native of Indiana, who came to Hattiesburg to repair an organ.  They made their home in Glendale, CA where they operated a music studio giving voice, piano and organ lessons.  They also worked diligently in their church.  They had no children.  They both died about 1992.

About 1928 Oliver bought a Ford 1 1/2 ton flat bed truck for his hauling business.  He hauled cornices and fancy brickwork used in construction of buildings at USM.  For a while Tolstoi "Tolly" Nordon, her nephew, lived with them and worked for him in Hattiesburg. 

Renie and Oliver moved to a large farm in the Richberg community outside Hattiesburg. 

About 1964 Renie and Olive and Brad (on a trip to Mississippi from California) came to Estabutchie to visit Solie and Iggie Sims.  At that time Renie weighed about 160 lbs.  She walked with a walking stick.  She had short curled, sandy-grey colored hair.

Sadly about 1963 ? Oliver died.  Tragically, Renie died about 1968 ?.  They are buried at Hattiesburg.
