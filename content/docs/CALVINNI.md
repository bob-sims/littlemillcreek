CALVIN GREENBERRY NIXON

Calvin was born August 27, 1857, the first child of William and Gabriella Parr Nixon.  He was born in Choctaw Co. in SW Alabama near the Mississippi state line.  Because both his parents were orphans, he never knew any of his grandparents.

His family moved to Panola Co. in northern MS in 1875.  His parents would remain there the rest of their lives.

Calvin remembered going to a ridge in the Tallahatchie River swamp where the passenger pigeons had roosted.  The weight of the huge flocks had broken limbs out of oak trees.  William and the neighbor men took their horses, wagons and shovels.  They collected wagonloads of bird droppings to fertilize their fields.

In the Fall in the swamp the beech trees produced bumper crops of seeds (mast).  The seeds would be ankle-deep on the ground.  Bears got fat on this mast.  Calvin described bear meat as good-even the fat was good.  You could drink it, and it wouldn't make you sick!
 
As an adult he weighed about 150# and had black, wavy hair.  As he aged, it turned grey.  Eventhough he inherited Native American blood, he had a mustache.  He never drank excessively.  He chewed Apple sun-cured tobacco.

Nixon men for generations have washed their hands and faces and combed their hair before coming to the table for a meal.  Calvin did this.  Every Sunday morning after breakfast he would read the 
Bible.

On April 2 or 11, 1882 or 1883 Calvin married Aura Ophelia Smith (b. Sept. 1, 1867), daughter of Andrew Jackson Smith and Sarah Nixon Smith.  Rev. Wm. E. Smith performed the ceremony in Jasper Co.  Unaware of their kinship, he married his first cousin.  (Her mother, Sarah Smith was his father, William Nixon's sister.)  She was called Ira or Ora or Oph as nicknames.

In 1890 Calvin's young family lived on the Willingham farm in Panola Co.  The tax roll that year showed that he owned one horse valued at $70.  For it he paid 28 cents in property tax!

About 1895 they moved to Jasper Co. in central MS.  The severe economic depression that began in 1893 possibly caused them to move close to her parents in Jasper Co.

About 1900 they moved south and settled in Jones Co.

Their children were: 

1) Etta Idell Nixon (b. 9 Dec 1888; md. E. Waldo Sims) 
2) Howard Nixon (b. 10 Aug 1892) 
3) Eugene Nixon (b. 19 July 1894; md. Alma West) 
4) Alonzo W. Nixon (b. 25 Mar 1896; d. 2 July 1959; md. Ethel Walters ; b. 11 Aug 1903; d. 29 Nov 1982). 
5) Shuford Henry Nixon (b. 21 Sept. 1898; d. 27 Feb 1980; md. Gertrude Bowman) 
6) Vicie Nixon (b. 2 Apr 1900; d. 10 Dec 1974; md. James Hearn) 
7) Bertha Nixon (b. 16 Mar 1905; md. Earl Holcomb)  
8) Charles Clifton "Jack" Nixon (b. 16 Oct 1907; d. 29 Dec 1956; md. Lexibee Kaiser (b. 15 Dec 1908; d. 26 May 1983)).

Calvin worked in sawmills.  In 1910 he was at the Estabutchie mill. Later he worked in Mr. Ikler's mill in Moselle.  As a lunch pail he carried a syrup bucket.  His lunch included several of the following: biscuit with butter and syrup, baked sweet potatoes, cooked field peas, or fried meat.  He took scrap wood tied with a cord home from the mill as firewood. 

Originally the men worked from daylight to dark, literally.  They would get up before dawn to be at the mill when there was enough light to begin work.  They would go home when there was not enough light to see to work.  Later they worked a 10 hour day.  In 1900 sawmill workers in Estabutchie were paid $1 a day.

The logs, primarily pine, were floated in holding ponds.  Early logs were up to 20'long.  About 1920 most were 12-16' long.  Using a long hooked pole a man on walkways over the water guided and pushed each log into a "V" shaped wood trough.  The trough sloped upwards.  A heavy, spiked chain slowly moved in the trough hoisting the logs up 12-14' into the sawmill.

The mill, a two story building, had two walls, with opposite ends open.  With a 60" vertical blade, the saw could cut a 30" swath.  At least one man was constantly sharpening spare saw blades.  About three times a day the old blade was replaced by a sharp one.  A steam device allowed the sawyer to rotate the log on the carriage.  First he squared the timber.  An edger, a bench machine, salvaged some 2 x 4's and other planks from slabs.  They cut from small 2" or 3" flooring up to 1" x 12" and 12" x 12" timbers.  The sawyer cut the sizes required for the orders.  Mr. Ikler sold most of his lumber to Sears & Roebuck.  It was shipped by rail to Chicago.

For drying, the lumber was moved on carriages into the drying kiln.  It measured 30-40' and had end doors on rollers.  Kiln sticks served as spacers between the tiers of lumber on the carriage.  This allowed the hot air to circulate between the planks.  The kiln was heated by steam in 1" black iron pipes at 2" intervals.  Sawdust and scrap lumber from the mill fueled the boiler to make the steam.  Each carriage stacked 12' high was rolled into the kiln (with the lumber crossways); the doors were closed; and that load was dried (steamed) for 1-2 days.  The boiler was stoked night and day continuously by a fireman.

The planer machine improved the finish and produced standard sizes.   The man who operated this machine pushed the plank alongside a right edge guide until it was drawn in by upper rollers and cut by 2-4 blades on a lower journal (elaborate shaft).  A steam engine  powered the belt turning the journal at 3500 rpm.  The operator pushed one plank out by pushing the next one in.  He used a steel lumber gauge to measure the sizes.  Calvin's grandson, Gene treasures his dad, Eugene's lumber gauge.

About 1910, tragically, the family home burned down.  Fortunately, they collected $400 in insurance.  This allowed Calvin to buy 20 acres of land about 1.5 miles E of Moselle, MS.  They moved to a 2 1/2 room house there.  

His grandson Victor remembers teasing the family cats.  Every night someone would open the door and hit the floor with a switch to chase the cats out of the house.  One night young Victor closed the door, and used the switch to hit the cats.  They made a big fuss.  Calvin said, "Ora, for God's sake make that boy let them pore dam cats out!" 

In 1920 he farmed about 20 acres in Jones Co.  On about 4 acres Calvin grew cotton.  To prepare he first burned the refuse from last years' crop.  With his horse he plowed the field and made up rows 3' apart.  Victor remembers following his Grandpa as he plowed.  In late March or early April a horse-drawn planter dropped and covered the cotton seeds. 

Later most of the family helped chop the cotton.  Using hoes, seedlings were thinned to one every 9".  He plowed the field to reduce grass about every 2 weeks until May 1st when the plants were too big.  

Boll weevils damaged some of the cotton.  Insecticides were not widely available.  (About 1925 Chester Moseley poisoned boll weevils for the first time with arsenic and made a better crop.)  Calvin made 1 or 2 bales of cotton a year.  In 1920 it would have sold for about $75 a bale.

One of his horses was about an 850# mare named Molly.  She was pretty with a blaze face and four white feet.  On a one horse farm she plowed, pulled the wagon, and did any other work needed.

He also grew corn, sweet potatoes, peas and sugar cane.

The cane was cut early in September before frost.  Cane piles were protected from freezing with a covering of cut cane tops (fodder).  Calvin made syrup once or twice at his place.  A mule pulled the grinder that squeezed the juice from the cane stalks.  The juice was cooked in a 4' x 8' evaporator pan with dividers every 8".  After several hours of cooking over a wood fire the syrup thickens.  Hot syrup was poured into gallon cans and clean hot jars.  

Every November he would buy a couple of 25# pigs.  These were fed kitchen scraps, old milk, hard corn, worm-eaten corn or collard leaves or sweet potatoes from the garden.  The next Fall after they had grown and fattened these would be slaughtered and smoked for meat.

Calvin also kept 15-20 goats and about 6 cows.  Goats could be slaughtered any time of the year.  The cows provided milk and calves that he sold.

He somehow obtained several stands of honeybees.  In the figure he proudly stands with Oph beside a patented bee-gum.


Calvin sold his farm to Mr. Bass.  He returned to sawmill work at Rhodes, MS SE of Laurel.  While there Calvin was injured by a roller at the mill.  After resting about a week, he returned to work.  However Mr. Bass was unable to make the payments on the place and after several trips Calvin reclaimed his farm.  He walked 15-20 miles one way on each of these trips.  He had an excellent sense of direction.

Old Henry, a black bird dog with a white spot on his breast, was left behind when they moved to Rhodes.  When Calvin returned from one of his trips trying to collect payments, unbeknownst to him Henry trailed him.  Before he reached home, his son Lon said, "I hear old Henry under the house."  The dog had overtaken and circled Calvin without being seen and continued to follow his earlier trail to the new home!

When they moved back they improved their house.  They added two rooms, each 14' x 14' to the rear of the house.  They added a new chimney with back to back fireplaces.  Bernie Weeks, a carpenter, did most of this work assisted by Calvin and his sons.

In 1929 Calvin and Ophelia lived beside Lon and Ethel (who helped care for them) in Oak Grove in Jones Co.  Calvin had a tremor and was no longer able to work.  The two youngest children, Bertha and Jack continued to live with them.

Ophelia developed diabetes.  Dr. Carter attended her. Sadly, she died 10 Jan 1932.  The funeral service was conducted by Rev. Nix, Rev. Weeks and Rev. Herrington. She is buried at the Pilgrim Cemetery near Ellisville in Jones Co.  The newspaper obituary concludes, ‘In love she lived, in peace she died’.

Many years of hard work and absorbing fluids and poisons from chewing tobacco weakened him.  Calvin died 9 June 1933 at the home of his son and daughter-in-law Lon and Ethel in the Oak Grove Community.  Rev. Weeks of Moselle conducted the funeral service and he is buried beside Ophelia in Pilgrim Cemetery.  His obituary from the Progress-Item newspaper described him as a man who ‘believed in  right living and practiced it daily.’
