Ruth, the youngest child, of Jeff and Mary Jane Roberts Havens, was born 9 April, 1895 at the family home north of Vancleave, MS.

On 4 Sept 1918 she married Paul Bob Kinch (b. 16 Oct 1893 in Grand Isle, Nebraska).  Paul's father was Emanuel Christian Kinch (b. 1841; d. 1934; a Civil War veteran with a leg wound that never healed.  It had to be dressed.)  Manuel and his second wife, Rosa Alice Riddle Kinch were Paul's parents. 

Paul had worked in water-well drilling before serving in the army in the Quartermaster Corp in World War I.  

First they lived in San Antonio, TX.  Later they moved and made their home in Lucedale, MS.  They lived first on Lampton road where Paul farmed.

They had three children:

1) Clothilde Kinch (b. 19 Feb 1920; 23 May 1942 md. J. H. Laird, Jr. (b. 29 Dec 1915 in Bay Co., FL; son of John H. Laird Sr, and his third wife Alma Pearl Underwood Laird); had two children; lived in Hattiesburg, MS).
2 & 3) Patricia Maudine Kinch (b. 10 Dec 1921; twin of Maxine Kinch (d. aged 18 months); md. John Bryant (b. 6 Jan 1919; d. 12 Jan 1983; son of Maude Thigpen Bryan and Charles Augustus Bryan); had two children).

The twins were born in the Biloxi Hospital.  While there Ruth was given a medication that caused her to act crazy.  She jumped out a second story window!  Fortunately, she completely recovered.

The family moved into Lucedale where Paul went into the gasoline business.  According to Victor Sims, he was a hard worker his entire life.  Beginning in 1923, he served as the local distributor for the Gulf Oil Co.  He hauled gasoline in 55 gallon drums with truck and trailer from Mobile, Sandersville and Hattiesburg to Lucedale.

In the 1930's he expanded his trucking business.  He hauled turnip greens locally and tung trees to Poplarville and Purvis, MS.  He affiliated with the American Oil Co. from Hattiesburg that handled Pure Oil products.  He operated a service station on Main St. in Lucedale.  In 1934 when the American Oil Co. bought out the Shell Co. in Lucedale, Paul operated another service station on Main St.

Because Paul loved baseball, the family spent several hot Sunday afternoons in Mobile at ball games.

During World War II he added a tire recapping shop to the service station.  He now owned and operated a tank truck to haul gasoline.

For a while Ruth bred and raised parakeets for sale.  She kept them in cages on the back porch and she had a screen house in the backyard for them.  In about 1950 she had about 40 birds.  She sold a blue one for about $2.50 to Elnora Breland for her son Elton.

In 1952 Paul affiliated with Conoco Oil Co.  At that time his business was named the Tri County Oil Company.  In 1955 it was incorporated in that name.
 
He built a truck stop East of Lucedale.
 
Ruth appreciated old furniture.  She owned a fine antique bedroom suite with a tester bed.

Ruth enjoyed growing flowering plants.  She had a green thumb for african violets.  In about 1952 she had propagated about 50 plants.

She kept and cared for pekinese dogs.

At about this time she had short gray hair and weighed about 180#.

Sadly, Paul died of lung cancer June 13, 1955.  He was buried at the Lucedale Cemetery.

Ruth lived until 1967.  She died on Sept. 29 that year and is buried beside Paul at the Lucedale Cemetery.
