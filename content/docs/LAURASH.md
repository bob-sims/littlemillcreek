Born November 27, 1870 Laura was the second child and oldest daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Campbell Sims.  She was born in a large, one-room log cabin with a dirt floor in Womack Hill in Choctaw Co. in SW AL.

She was called "Sister" by members of her family.

In school she learned to recite the names of the 38 states and 10 territories in the order in which they joined the union.   As an adult she remembered this.

Laura was an exuberant, vivacious girl with blue eyes.

In December 1891 after her father's and older brother Bailey's tragic deaths, the family moved to Mississippi. 

To help support the family she worked setting type.  She also worked at a cottonmill in Stonewall, MS.

On December 10, 1896, she married John William Horton.  Born Sept. 15, 1854, John's parents were William and Charlotte Ellis Horton.  William was killed at Petersburg, VA in the Civil war.  John was 42 and Laura was 26.            

In 1900 they lived in Waynesboro, MS.  The census reports that John was hauling logs.

As a log man he was attracted to Purvis in Lamar county by its sawmill.  About 1901 they settled in Purvis.  The county seat, it is served by the Southern Railroad between Meridian and New Orleans.  

John hauled logs with oxen teams from the forest to either the sawmill or rail spur lines that carried them to the mill.  He maintained two teams of 10 oxen each with some spare animals.  Each animal was a neutered male from 8 to 16 years old.  Because they continue growing as they age, they increase from about 800 lbs to as much as 1600 lbs.  A black gum yoke linked each ox with his partner.  Each kept the same partner.  Early they learn to step in unison and pull together.

The driver walks to the left of his team (the near side).  Good teamsters constantly talk to their team.  The rhythm of his voice helps the team.  He uses "gee" (for right), "haw, or come here" (for left), "whoa" (for stop) and a whip.  On a 6' wooden stock the whip is 3.5' of 4-plaited leather with a fringe tip.  The driver would touch a particular oxen with the whip to communicate.

Teamsters worked their teams 6 days a week from daylight to dark.  Poor weather in winter limited them.  Mr. Horton said, "If you could make your ox feed in January and February, you were doing good." 

He contracted for the hauling with the sawmill.  The J. J. Newman Lumber Co. in Hattiesburg probably owned the Purvis sawmill.  While most logs were pine, the sawyers also cut hardwoods including oak, gum and poplar.  At the mill the logs were dumped in a holding lake. Insects cannot damage the wood underwater.

Laura and John had the following children: 

1) Charlotte Elizabeth "Lottie" Horton, (named for her two grandmothers, b. Sept. 30, 1898; Mar 7, 1918 md. Fred Lemuel Todd (b. Nov 15, 1893 in Rockport, IN; d. Dec 14, 1975 in Jackson, MS)) 
2) Ruby Eloise Horton (b. July 17, 1900; Dec 21, 1919 md. Jacob Ester Pruitt (b. Apr 26, 1896 in Winchester, Tenn; d. July 9, 1951 in Mobile, AL)) 
3) Kenneth Douglas Horton (b. Oct. 25, 1902?; d. August 31, 1979; md. 1) Ruth ____  2) Dec 10, 1949 Lois Melba Hayles (b. Nov 28, 1917 in Uriah, AL; d. Sept. 28, 1972 in Mobile, AL)) 	
4) Cecil Lyndal Horton (b. Dec 14, 1905; d. May 21, 1991; Mar 8, 1941 md. Barbara Williams; divorced 1942).  
5) Ernest Wiley Horton (b. 1908).  

The girls were born in Waynesboro; the boys in Purvis.  Sadly, Wiley died of a childhood disease, possibly whooping cough when about 10 months old.

Although Purvis had no hospital at this time, Dr. Mackie practiced medicine there.  By 1930 he had moved to Hattiesburg, where he removed a cyst from the corner of Margaret Sims' eye.

The family lived in a nice one floor, four bedroom house with a front porch.  In the backyard they had an outdoor toilet and a bored well.  The children drew water in a 5" tubular bucket that held about 2 gallons.

In about 1916 when Victor visited there was a hole in the ceiling of the backporch where Kenneth had accidentally discharged a 20 gauge shotgun.  Laura made a fine raisen pie for the visit.

Early in 1908 Laura had the same bad dream several times.  In the dream she saw rows of coffins.  This was a sort of premonition. 

In April of that year a severe tornado devastated Purvis.  When they heard the roar of the approaching storm young Cecil ran  under the piano.  It was a long rectangular piano raised up on 4 tall legs, allowing Cecil to sit beneath it.  Laura and the other children followed him and huddled there.  Although the tornado killed several people in Purvis, Laura and the children were not injured.  John Horton who was not able to find shelter had a board hit and injure his back.  Their house was destroyed except the floor.  Their close neighbors Mr. and Mrs. King and their son Harold also lost their home.

That same day Solie Sims, Laura's brother, saw an object in the sky above Estabutchie, about 22 miles away in Jones Co.  When it fell to the ground he retrieved a wooden shingle from a roof.  The storm wind had blown it from Purvis!

The 1910 census records that John was working as a salesman in the sawmill commissary.  They owned their home that was mortgage-free.

After the local timber was all cut, John farmed outside town.  He grew vegetables such as corn and potatoes that they hauled to town by the wagonload.

For several years Ruby took piano lessons.  She learned to play popular tunes such as "Under the Double Eagle."

About 1914 for several years Laura operated a hotel/boarding house.  It was a handsome three story frame structure. 

During the Christmas holiday in 1914 Laura rode the train to visit her brother Waldo and his family in Moselle.  She arrived when young Victor was still in bed.  She woke him up by reciting the poem, "Twas the Night Before Christmas" at his bedside.

Sadly, John Horton died of liver cancer May 20, 1918.  Dr. Mackey had cared for him.  The newspaper obituary described him as "an honest, upright hard working gentleman that attended strictly to his own affairs and meddled not with his neighbors."  Idell Sims and Grace attended his funeral.  He was buried in Purvis.

According to the 1920 census, her oldest son, Kenneth, was the proprietor of a pressing shop.  He was 17 at the time.

In the 1920's Cecil traveled in Europe.  He saw conditions there that seriously disturbed him.  This was the beginning of his problems that later required him to be institutionalized.

After Governor Theodore Bilbo took office in 1916 he established homes for rowdy children, children of alcoholics and orphans.  The Columbia Industrial Training School was built in Columbia, west of Purvis.  It housed about 80-100 children.  Laura was made matron over the older boys, 12-16 years old.  She guided and directed them helping them with their homework.  She worked there in 1932.

Later Victor's friend from the papermill, Mr. Bill Hateley, who was a pupil there, paid her a tribute.  He said, "The finest lady he had known in his entire life was Mrs. Horton at the school."

Laura never owned a car and never learned to drive.

About 1934 after her children were grown, Laura stayed with their families for 6 month visits.  She lived with Ruby and Ester Pruitt and their family in Vicksburg for 6 months.  While there she taught her granddaughters Mary Frances and little Ruby to crochet and to embroider.  She had round doilies bordered with heavy lace.  The design had been worked in white embroidery thread.  The girls went over it with colored embroidery thread.  

She prized two books: a soft, suede-covered book of Longfellow poems and a poetry anthology in hardback.  She read her favorites such as "The Wreck of the Hesperus" by Longfellow to her grandchildren.

Lottie's husband, Fred Todd, a retired lieutenant from World War I, was the head of the YMCA in Jackson, Mississippi.  After Cecil finished Coyne Electrical School he worked in Jackson.  He helped organize the first electrical workers union there.  Laura and Cecil lived with the Todds for a while in Jackson.

Beginning in 1939 she lived with Kenneth in Mobile at 34 McPhillips Ave.  Kenneth worked as secretary from the Gulf Mobile & Ohio Railroad.

About 1943 Cecil bought a house on Grant Ave. in Pascagoula.  Laura lived there for several years.  Cecil built an outdoor shower beside this house.  (This house was not sold until about 1962.)  Laura put kitchen scraps in the yard in a cracked dish.  A turtle would come and eat from the dish.  Every day the turtle would eat there.  One day two turtles appeared together.

About 1946 Laura returned to Mobile.  She lived with her daughter Ruby Horton Pruitt on Garnett St.  She remained with Ruby the rest of her life.

Slowly over time she lost some weight.  In her later years Laura became frail.  The doctor told Ruby that she was "just worn out."  She became bedridden in late November, 1961.  She died at home April 2, 1962.  Her nephews Victor and Bruce Sims served as pall-bearers at her funeral.  She is buried in the Pine Crest Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama.
