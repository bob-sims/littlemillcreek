John was born in Frederick Co, the northernmost county in VA the son of John Havens I.  He was born about 1755 (?).

According to Cyril Cain's excellent work, John and his wife had the following children:

John Havens III (b. 1775; d. 1855).
Sally Havens (md. ___ Henry).
Polly Havens (md. ___ Hall).
James Havens (md. ___ ___; had 3 children; served in West FL Rebellion in 1810 and War of 1812).
Nancy Havens (md. "Dutchman").
Massie Havens (md. ___ Ballard).
Stephen Havens (a taxpayer in 1815).
Joseph Havens (a soldier in War of 1812).
Howard Havens (md. twice; reared second family in New Orleans, LA).
Elizabeth Havens (b. 1800, the youngest child; md. Henry Flurry).

In 1782 the state Census of Virginia listed John's household with 3 whites.  Those were probably he, his wife and oldest child.  No slaves were ever present.

From 1787 personal property tax records remain for Frederick Co., VA.  John owned 1 horse and 4 cows.

Probably because of poor soils in that area, between 1787 and 1798 the family moved to Mobile AL.

Spanish law that prevailed at that time in Mobile required that all children regardless of the faith of the parents were to be baptized by a Catholic priest.  Among the baptisms in early Catholic church records in Mobile three entries probably describe this family.  On 19 Aug 1798, Stephen and Sophia children of Juan Haven and Sara Groase, protestants, were baptized.  Stephen we can identify, but it is not clear which girl was also named Sophia.

On 3 Apr. 1799, Francisco and Sara, children of Juan Hoven (Haven) and Sara Grelert were baptized.  Again Sara we can identify, but Francisco we cannot.  

On 3 Oct 1804, Elizabeth, born 28 Dec 1800, daughter of Juan Evens and Sara Covert, natives of South Carolina (?) was baptized in Pascagoula, MS.  Assuming that these records describe our family, John's wife was Sara ____.

Creole Mobile listed both he and his son John among colonial families of the gulf coast.

Tragically, about 1800 John died, possibly of yellow fever.  He's buried in Mobile at an unknown site.

Shortly thereafter the family moved to Jackson Co. MS.  They may have settled in the Poticaw community.  

John's wife, Sara, is buried at Poticaw Landing, according to Cyril Cain.
