Caroline was the only child of Susan Hester Sims McMichael (b. May 15, 1812) and Lamuel McMichael (b. 1797 in GA).  Susan and Samuel, widow and widower from previous marriages, both had older children.  Caroline was born Dec 8, 1854 in Choctaw Co., AL.

In the 1860 federal census she is recorded as 6.  Her half brothers, the three youngest Sims boys, are listed as Simmonses.

In the 1870 census at 15 she is recorded as attending school within the year.

On Feb 16, 1873 she married James Radford Moseley (b. 1844 in AL).  Jim had served in Company D of the 40th AL regiment in the Civil War.  The Rev. V. R. Williams performed the ceremony.

He farmed in Choctaw Co. where they lived their entire lives. 

The 1880 census reports that neither she nor Jim could read or write.

They had the following children: 

1) Mallie Moseley (b. Dec. 24, 1873; d. Dec 18, 1951; md. John T. Doggett (b. Jan 15, 1862; in 1910 operated a general store; d. Feb 27, 1952)).
2) Lenora "Nora" Moseley (b. Dec 2, 1877; d. Sept 12, 1958; md. William Henry Edgar (b. Apr. 30, 1872; d. Jun. 18, 1954) both buried at Ball Cemetery near Bexley, in George Co., MS).
3) Susan Moseley (b. Mar 2, 1882; d. Aug. 24, 1915; md. Hubert A. "Bud" Campbell (b. Feb. 1, 1884; d. Mar 30, 1941; buried at Quitman, MS).
4) James Radford Moseley (b. Jan 6, 1885; died of colitis Aug. 1885).
5) Carrie Lily Mae Moseley (b. Nov 26, 1886; d. Mar. 2, 1964; Feb 1, 1911 md. Martin C. Bonner (b. Sept. 17, 1881; d. Mar 4, 1969) buried at Mt. Zion Cemetery, Wayne Co., MS).
6) Lola Moseley (b. Feb 3, 1890; d. Jan 17, 1959 or 60; md. Elbert Ray Norden (b. Aug. 4, 1889 in AL; d. June 2, 1960) buried at Barrytown Cemetery, Choctaw Co, AL).
7) Herman Moseley (a girl, named for Mt. Herman in the Holy land; b. Mar 23, 1892; d. Jan 7, 1978 or 79; md. Frank Johnson (b. Nov 7, 1882; d. Aug 20, 1963) buried at Barrytown Cemetery, Choctaw Co., AL).

In 1900 the census records five girls living at home.  Only Nora has married.  Jim was described as a farmer.  Even the 26 year old Mattie was described as "at school"!  They owned their farm free of a mortgage.

Her husband, Jim died in 1909 and was buried in the Barrytown Church of God cemetery east of Gilbertown, AL.

In 1910 the censustaker finds only the three youngest girls living at home with their mother.

In 1920 Lola and her husband Elbert Nordan (recorded as Elbert Wardon by the census) with their baby girl, Carrie (b. 1917), lived with Caroline.

In March 1929 Iggie and Maggie Sims, Solie Sims and Victor Sims drove in Iggies's black 1929 A-model coupe to visit the family.  Caroline lived in a big log house on the spot where W. M. "Buster" Carlisle would later build his home.  The visitors slept in the homes of others in the family, because their daughter, Lola had a baby girl (Opal Norden Carlisle) in their home that night!  Because her mother Susan was a midwife, Caroline was able to help with the birth.  

During their visit Caroline was busy and active caring for folks.  She wore a long dress.  The next morning she led the Simses into the bedroom to show them the big, new, pink baby.  At age 76, she had soft, full gray hair, and weighed about 140 lbs.  Victor, her great nephew, described her as "very sweet and angelic." 

Caroline died July 7, 1945.  She's buried beside Jim in the Barrytown Church of God cemetery.
