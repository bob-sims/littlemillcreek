St. Cyr (pronounced Sancher or Sancere) was born August 11, 1827.  He was the fifth son of St. Cyr Seymour (b. 1788) and Marie Joseph Ryan Seymour (b. Mar 17, 1786).

He married Anna Margaret McCarthy (b. 1827) in about 1847.

St. Cyr probably homesteaded land in the Latimer community north of Ocean Springs in Jackson Co.  He bought land from the government.  He bought 80 acres on Dec. 31, 1856; 40 acres on May 14, 1860; 40 acres March 19, 1861; and 80 acres May 21, 1869.  (These tracts lie in sections 22, 34 and 35 of township 6 south range 9 west.)  Thus he accumulated land.  When his children were grown, he gave each of them 40 acres of land.

Anna and he had the following children:

1) Coralie (or Aralie or Caroline) Seymour (b. 1849??).
2) Calvin Seymour (b. July 30, 1850; d. Dec 15, 1922; md. Elizabeth Mulholland).
3) Zeolide Seymour (b. Sept. 23, 1854; d. Jan 25, 1929; Aug. 25, 1875 md. Henry Deloney (b. Mar 11, 1853; d. Feb 11, 1   )).
4) Cora Seymour (b. 1857?).
5) St. Cyr Seymour III (b. Apr. 25, 1859; d. Jun 26, 1912; 1878 md. Caroline Quave).
6) Octavia Seymour (b. Apr. 2, 1861; d. Jun 11, 1918; md. A. S. Krohn (b. Mar 29, 1859; d. Feb 4, 1935)).
7) Pierre Seymour (b. June 7, 1863).
8) Beauregard Louis Seymour "Borie" (b. Mar. 5, 1866; md. Mary Jolie Connaught (b. 7 Jan 1873; d. 11 Aug 1942); had Mary Alice; divorced due to his excessive drinking).
9) Margaret Ann Seymour (b. June 6, 1868; md. Albert Scarborough).

On November 25, 1872 Anna died.

About 1875 St. Cyr married Victoria Deloney (or Delaunais).  Their homeplace was on a bluff across the branch from where Ed and Bertha Brodnax later lived.  

They had the following children:

1) Morris Ledger Seymour (b. Oct 23, 1876; d. Oct 13, 1941).
2) Leon Seymour (b. 1877?; never married). 
3) Ernest Adolphe Seymour (b. Sept. 24, 1878; d. Jan 27, 1963; never md.).
4) Marie Olivia Seymour (b. Dec. 31, 1879; d. 1960?; Dec 28, 1907 md. James William Scarborough, a cousin of Albert, (b. Sept 16, 1872; d. 1952?); had 3 boys and 1 girl, May; developed arthritis).
5) Robert Seymour, "Bob", (b. Apr. 11, 1881; d. Nov 22, 1952; never md.).
6) Victoire Seymour "Aunt Jinks" (b. Feb 15, 1883).

The family had slaves.  For a long time posts remained out in the back behind the old home.  These were part of slave cabins.  After the Civil War some former slaves adopted the name Seymour.

He chose the Seymour cemetery site on his land.  His grandson Jeff Seymour, Calvin's son, who died in 1902 was the first grave there.

St. Cyr died Oct 15, 1903.  His obituary from "The Daily Herald" reads,

"St. Cyr Seymour aged 76 years died last night across Back Bay.  Mr. Seymour was born at Fountainbleu, Miss. and has been living in his present home 72 years.  He was twice married and leaves 14 children.  The funeral will take place tomorrow."

He is buried at the Seymour Cemetery.

Victoria, whose death date is unknown, was buried at the old Deloney homeplace in D'Iberville in the yard.  Her grave was the only burial there, according to May Graham, a granddaughter.  Later a Dr. Johnson, a chiropractor, lived and practiced in the house there.
