Jeff was born 28 July 1846.  He was the eighth child and fourth son of John Havens IV "Jack" and Sabra Ann Fletcher Havens. 

In growing up he had enough contact with Indians to learn to count in their language.  Chickamunga was one number.

In 1864 Jeff enlisted in the Confederate army.  He served as a bugler boy under Captain Murrel.  He was captured and held as a prisoner of war.  He told Clinton Cates of his experiences with the northern armies in Virginia. 

Prior to his release he was required to sign an oath of allegiance to the U. S. government.  He signed the oath on June 5, 1865 in Mobile, Alabama.  He is described on the certificate as 18 years of age, 5' 8" tall, with dark hair, hazel eyes and fair complexion.  His occupation is listed as "stock raiser" and his residence, "Jackson Co., Miss".

After his release from the prison camp, he walked and hitched rides home.

On December 31, 1868, he married Mary Jane Roberts (b. Nov. 23, 1853). She was the daughter of James and Mary Ann "Polly" Goff Roberts.  Mary Jane was the sister of Jeff's uncle Charles Havens' wife.

Jeff bought land from his father, land his father had homesteaded.

Between 1869 and 1877 while Ulysses Grant was President, he and Pierre Bang, a Creole man (of Indian, French and Negro ancestry) rode to Jackson, MS on horseback to get patents on their lands.  The entire trip took one month.  The patent featured President Grant's signature.  Recently, regrettably, this original document was stolen by an official at the Jackson Co. Courthouse.

In 1870 the US census listed Jeff as a farmer.  That year he valued his real estate at $100 and his personal estate at nil.

The children attended school at the Jeff Havens school about 1 mile north (of the Jim Kelly home) through the woods.  Jeff sawed a log as a footlog for them to cross the branch.  Mary Anderson taught about 50 children there in 1888.

According to Cyril Cain Jeff was named for 2 Methodist ministers: Jefferson Bond and Henry T. Hill.  Thus it was fitting that he became a minister and began to preach at Methodist churches.  He was a member of the Pine Grove Methodist Church at one time.  He served primarily at the Mt. Pleasant Church north of Vancleave.

Albert Orrell gave 40 acres of land north of Vancleave for the establishment of the New Prospect Campground.  Jeff was a leader in planning the campground.  In 1880 Jeff served on a committee to select the site for the campground.

The federal agricultural census in 1880 described his farm.  He tilled 12 acres on a farm he owned valued at $300.  His farm impliments had a value of $15; his livestock, a value of $400; his farm production, a value of $200.  His livestock included 1 horse, 1 mule or ass, 2 cows and 100 sheep.  His ewes dropped 20 lambs, but 50 sheep died of disease.  During the previous year he spent $150 building fences and $50 on fertilizer to produce 2 tons of hay and 250 lbs. of wool.  From 9 acres of corn he harvested 150 bushels.  From 1 acre he harvested 100 bushels of sweet potatoes.  He cut 40 cords of wood.  It was sold (probably as charcoal) for $40.

On Jan. 24, 1887 Jeff purchased 40 acres of land (Sec 22, Twnshp. 5S, R 7) from the government.  On August 27, 1892 he purchased 80 acres of land (Sec 17, Twnshp. 4S, R 7) from the government.

Sadly on April 22, 1890 his son, Val died.

The 1900 federal census lists Jeff as a farmer who owned his farm
free of a mortgage.  

Before 1915 he built the Havens tent at the campground.  The original campground was lighted by bonfires built on platforms around the central tabernacle.  About 30" high these had packed dried clay tops that became bricklike to prevent the platform from burning down.  Jeff and his family would come by horse and buggy about 7 miles from their home.

The 1910 federal census, recorded April 20, 1910, lists him age 64 as a farmer.  He has 19 farm buildings.  Mary Jane, 55, and their three youngest daughters, Lily, 24, Jennie, 22 and Ruth, 15, complete the household. 

On January 15, 1920, the census records him as a farmer.  He's 73; Mary Jane is 66.  Aunt Lil, their maiden daughter, and Henry Justin Green, 7 (Aunt Jenny's son), live with them.

August 15, 1922 he applied for a pension as a veteran of the Civil war.

At age 86 in May 1933, he assisted with a special Mother's Day program at the Vancleave Methodist Church.  He pronounced the benediction.

On December 31, 1934 they celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary!  An open house was held at the family home on Sunday, December 30 to honor this extraordinary event.  The "Moss Point Advertizer" newspaper article says that this, ..." is a remarkable piece of news, remarkable that in this restless day and time a couple should live together for more than the ordinary span of human life, and for the further fact that both of them are in a good state of health and have all their mental faculties preserved to a wonderful degree."

The same news article states that Jeff has, ..."the respect and esteem of hundreds of persons who know him."  It continues, "The same may be said of Mrs. Havens."

In the History of Jackson Co., MS (1989) Mrs. Wilma Goff remarks, "Rev. Jeff Havens... meant much as a local preacher and a strong Christian." 

After about a three week illness Mary Jane died June 2, 1936.  Her death certificate specifies the cause of death as arteriosclerosis.

Jeff died January 25, 1940.  His death certificate gives his cause of death as myocarditis.  Rev. Olia Nix of the Vancleave Methodist Church conducted the funeral.  He is buried with Mary Jane at the Havens cemetery north of the Jim Kelly place off of highway 57.

The "Moss Point Advertizer" newspaper (Feb 22, 1940) said in its obituary:

"Thus passes one of the grand old men of Jackson County, perhaps its oldest citizen.  He was born on July 28, 1846, and lived his entire life on the place where he was born, making his own living, asking help of no man, doing his duty as he saw it, and ever ready to answer the call of distress and to assist those less fortunate than he.  Of such men were the bone and sinew of this country.  In early life he was a Methodist preacher, an old-time circuit rider, who rode from point to point on horseback preaching the Gospel and ministering to the afflicted and distressed ones in his charge.  He farmed, while preaching, raised some cattle, and always, even until long past the age of retirement, made his own living, spending his declining years in his own home.  Few men have such a record.

Uncle Jeff's daughter, Mrs. Eunice Green, resided with him, and she and her daughter, Genevieve Green, cared for him in his later years, giving him constant attention, doing all they could to make him happy as he approached the time when "The sun went down on his beautiful past," a past that was made beautiful by a life of service and devotion to his church, his country and his family."
