Sarah was born in Marlboro Co., SC, between 1780 and 1793.  She was possibly the daughter of John Pledger, the only Pledger listed in the 1790 census of the Cheraw District (which would later become Marlboro Co).  Phillip Pledger, a pioneer in that area had sons John and Joseph.  Perhaps Phillip was Sarah’s grandfather.  In 1790 John’s household included 2 white males over 10 years of age, 2 under 10, 2 white females and 8 slaves.

Sadly, one or both of her parents died, because in February 1804  she appears before the court asking that William Henry Pledger be named her guardian. Wm. Henry Pledger must have been a relative, possibly an older brother, or an uncle.

About 1805 she married Wm. Griffin Steed Sr. They had a son, William Griffin Steed Jr. born about 1806. (Griffin Jr. married ___ ___ and had 2 young boys and 2 young girls in 1840.  Later either he or his son Griffin III married Martha ___ (b. Dec 6, 1844). Martha’s husband died before Sept 29, 1868 when Martha married a second time to Henry M. Pearson (b. Aug 27, 1836).)  

Again tragedy struck when Sarah’s husband died in 1809.  

On 29 Nov 1809 court records reveal Sarah’s intention to marry Wm. Henry Pearson. In about 1810 they married.  He was the oldest son of Moses Pearson II and Rachel Blair Pearson of that same county.  He was probably born between 1765 and 1770.

Sarah and Henry had the following known children:

1) Delinda Pearson (b. 1811??; married Daniel R. McColl).   
2) Elizabeth Pearson (b. Jan 1, 1814; never married; d. July 30, 1872).
3) Annice Pearson (b. Oct 7, 1816; md. Elias Campbell (b. July 4, 1814; d. Dec 4, 1868); moved in 1852 to Choctaw Co., AL; d. Dec 23, 1871).

Henry died suddenly in 1818, between May 4 and May 16, possibly of malaria or yellow fever.  On May 4 he was serving as an administrator on his brother Lamuel’s (or Samuel's) estate, but on May 16 Sarah and Samuel Townsend applied to the court to serve as administrators of Henry's estate. 

Before January 18, 1819, Sarah married Daniel L. Britton (b.   ), a court appraiser (with 3 others) of Henry's estate.

Daniel squandered their assets.  The court appoints a series of administrators of Henry’s estate to serve with Daniel and Sarah.  Later each in turn asks to be relieved because the estate is mismanaged. Daniel disappears after 1821 (when his name last appears in court records).  He either died or moved on to new territory.

Sarah bought a 60 acre farm from Robert Campbell.

In 1830 in the federal census she is listed as the head of the household with one girl 10-15, one 15-20, one woman 20-30 and Sarah 40-50.  She owned 9 slaves.

In 1838, 1839, 1845 and 1848 she appeared before the Court of Common Pleas for debts.  The debts equaled $61.50, $97,66, $41.04, $95.52 and $71.50.  She was apparently unable to pay.

In 1840 the census recorded one boy 5-10, 2 women 20-30, Sarah 50-60, and 3 male slaves and 4 female ones.  Three from the household worked in agriculture.  Ann Campbell, 60-70, lived next door.

In 1850 census Sarah's farm is valued at $350.  Her son-in-law Elias Campbell, a wheelwright, is listed as head of the household.  He and Annice and their young children live with her.  They live near the farm of her son, William Griffin Steed Jr.

The Slave schedule for 1850 states that she owned 17 slaves ranging in age from 6 months to 60 years.  Her son owned 11.

The agricultural census for that year described her farm.  They cultivated 10 acres.  Their farm implements were valued at $90; their homemade manufacture, $75; the animals slaughtered, $25.  Their livestock included 3 horses, 1 milk cow, 8 other cows and 8 hogs with a total value of $280.  In the previous year their farm produced 150 bushels of corn and 25 bushels of sweet potatoes.

On Nov 21, 1851 she and her son signed a deed selling her 60 acre farm to David Hartlee for $400.  

On December 8, 1851 Daniel & Delinda McColl, her son-in-law and daughter, filed a petition in the Court of the Ordinary to obtain Delinda’s share of the estate of her father, Wm. Henry Pearson.  The disposition of this action is unknown.

At about this time Elias and Annice Campbell and their family moved to SW Alabama.  

Although there are no records to confirm it, I assume that Sarah moved with them. We have no records of when or where she died.
