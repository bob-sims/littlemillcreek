Bill Havens was born July 19, 1870, the son of the Rev. Jefferson Hill Havens and Mary Jane Roberts Havens.  He was born at the old Taylor place north of Vancleave.  According to Cyril Cain, he was named for his uncle Randall Roberts.

His father was a Methodist minister and farmer.

He attended school in a building north of the location of his future farm.  He completed the eighth grade.  This provided a good education for that time.

He met Dora Seymour (b. Jan. 21, 1874) when he went hunting cows that had strayed from the meadow where they were pastured.  

They applied for a marriage license to Clerk of Circuit Court W. M. Denny on August 25, 1894.  They married on September 3, 1894.  Judge Ellis Overstreet of Moss Point performed the ceremony.  Bill had a wedding ring, but he rarely wore it.  (Jeff inherited it.)

As a young adult he had brown hair and greenish brown eyes. Approximately 5' 10" tall, he weighed about 150 lbs.

In 1893, a masonic lodge was established in Daisy Vestry in northern Jackson Co.  In February 1895, the first masonic lodge, the Ezell Lodge, was established in Vancleave.  Henry C. Havens, Bill's uncle, served as the first Worshipful Master.  Bill and his father, Jeff, were members of the masonic lodge.  They often went to meetings together.

As the son of a Methodist minister, Bill raised his family in the Methodist Church.  They attended Sunday School and Church; Bill said grace before every meal; they read a Bible verse and said a prayer as a family before retiring to bed in the evening.  Bill always recited this grace: "Lord, forgive us our sins, and accept our thanks for these and all Thy many blessings, for Christ's sake we ask.  Amen."

To thank a person for a favor or to show his appreciation he would say, "Much obliged".

He had a silver Elgin pocket watch.  When working it the field he left it at home, he estimated the time from the shadows of the corn plants.  (Ira inherited his watch.)

On June 15, 1904 he bought 40 acres of land from the government.  Situated in section 28 of township 5 south, range 7 west, Bill paid $1.25 per acre for a total of $50.

Bill worked oxen.  He hauled all the lumber for his farm buildings from a sawmill at Brewton's Landing, two miles south of Elsie and Roscoe Fletcher's home.  (Brewton's landing was named for Walter Green's grandfather Brewton.)  When he was ready to move his mill, the sawmill operator paid Bill to clean up the site where his sawmill had been by essentially giving him the lumber that was there.  Bill hired Dobbie Mayfield with his oxen and wagon to help.  He took lumber as pay too.

They departed at daylight taking their lunches and drove to the mill.  It was down a steep bluff beside the Pascagoula River.  (Most of the lumber milled there had been carried away by boat.)  Because the oxen could not pull a heavy load up the steep slope, they began the day by hauling Bill's large wagon half full to the top of the bluff.   Then using the smaller wagon they made several trips up the slope adding each to the larger wagon.  Because the trip home required about 3 hours, they made one trip a day.  At the sawmill they dismantled the buildings and cleaned up the site.

Bill used mules to move creosote timbers for the construction of the old highway 90 bridge across the Pascagoula River.  He moved the piling from where they were dumped on the river bank to where they were needed.  He used a two wheel cart, with 8' diameter wheels.  Because the mules had shoes and because the ground was frozen hard as a brick,  the mules and cart didn't sink into the mud and he was able to finish the job in one day!

Later Bill hauled the lumber for the construction of the hexagonal school in Vancleave.

Bill's farm stock included 4 horses, about 100 cattle, 50-100 sheep, 30-40 goats and 2 hogs.  The goat house was across the road in front of the house beside a pond.  The goats returned to this shelter every night.

He planted pecan trees around the house and later established an orchard south of the house.  The income from specific pecan trees was designated to pay property taxes.

On April 20, 1910, the federal census recorded him as a farmer aged 39.  His farm included 26 buildings.  Dora, 36, and the six oldest children complete the family.  May, Dolf, Jeff and Ira were attending school.

Bill became a champion sheep shearer.  Using manual, hand-held shears, he could shear 60 sheep by 1 pm!

For several years Bill grew cotton.  He carried his first cotton to Lucedale to the nearest gin.  Later Clifton L. Dees operated a gin (for a short time) across the road from his store in Vancleave.  About 1920 a bale of cotton sold for $50.

Bill developed a successful way to grow corn together with velvet beans.  Unlike many, he produced a bumper crop of corn and velvet beans every year.  

To prepare the field he plowed in stable manure and phosphoric acid fertilizer (made from treating crushed phosphate rock with 10% sulfuric acid).  The Hastings Prolific corn seed saved from the previous year was planted according to the phase of the moon (usually in April).  One grain was planted about every 10" along two rows; then a row was skipped throughout the 20 acre field.

The field was plowed every week to kill grass and weeds.  Bill's team pulled the riding cultivator that plowed one row.  He also plowed the empty rows.  When the corn plants reached 6-8", the corn was chopped with a hoe leaving one plant every 20".

About May 1 when the corn was 1' tall, Bill planted velvet beans from saved seeds about 2' apart in the empty rows.  The beans grew quickly.  Bill continued to plow the field until the beans reached about 30" tall and started to run.

After the corn crop was made and the lower fodder began to turn yellow, Bill hired Minnie Mayfield to help him break over the corn stalks toward the nearest bean row.  Wearing gloves they bent the corn in the middle of a joint beneath the lowest ear laying it on the bean plants.  Soon bean vines covered the entire field with their tags of purple blooms.

In September they harvested the corn by hand.  About Christmas time the cows had stripped food from the woods.  Initially Bill put the cows in the bean field for 20 minutes a day.  They ate the velvet beans high in oil and protein from the ground.   After about 3 days he lengthened their stay.  They fed on beans and corn fodder as well.  After about a month the cows had grown fat.  When the beans were gone, he began to give the cows corn.  Following this system, he brought his cattle through the winter every year healthy and fat.

The family's first automobile was a 1917 car.  Later they bought a Model T Ford.

In 1930 Dr. R. N. Murphy practiced as a veterinarian in Vancleave.  Bill routinely wormed his horses and cows.  He poured the medicine down their throats using a hose with a funnel on the end.  Once when a horse got fistulous withers he ordered medicine for it.  The medicine came with a syringe for injecting it and instructions to wear rubber gloves for the treatment.  The same bacterium that causes this causes syphilis.

To provide a cash income, Bill sold cattle, timber, sweet potatoes, syrup and charcoal that he made.  

To make the charcoal he burned pine trunks and limbs from pine tops in earthen ovens.  The wood was formed into a mound, 16 to 20 ft across and 4 to 8 ft high.  Pitch pine was placed in the center with pieces radiating out to the margin.  About a foot of packed dirt covered the kiln.  The pitch pine was set afire.  Holes allowed air to reach the pine.  The kiln got hot enough to vaporize the resins and tar from the wood.  From 5 days to one week of firing was required to make the charcoal.  The fire was extinguished by filling the air holes.  Charcoal was widely used as fuel before natural gas became available.  It was sold in cities and commercial laundries depended on it.

Schooners that docked near the swimming hole in Bluff Creek bought the charcoal and turpentine. They brought various products for sale.  After he purchased farm machinery in New Orleans, he paid Westphall's schooner to transport it to Vancleave for him.

Bill also sold hogs that he butchered to Uncle Edgar Seymour.  Uncle Edgar operated a meat market on Back Bay in Biloxi.  By going along old Seaman road, Bill saved 12 miles on this trip.

He kept a savings account at the Ocean Springs State Bank in Ocean Springs.  In 1929 he didn't lose any money.  However for a time they were unable to withdraw their money.  They encouraged the children to save and established savings accounts for each of their children.

He enjoyed hunting.  He killed many deer, squirrels and turkeys.  At first he used a muzzle-loading gun that his father gave him. (Later he gave that gun to Ira.)  He had reloading tools to make his own shells.

Bill Havens was known for his sense of humor.  He would tease young grandsons to go snake-hunting with him.  His eyes would twinkle.  He would give young Havens Fletcher a nickel or a quarter and ask him to buck dance for him.

In 1951 Bill became ill with shingles.  Dr. Gruich applied a salve and dressed his belly where the blisters occurred.

As he aged he suffered with asthma.  It limited what he could do.  Elsie would give him an injection for relief.

Sadly, he died of a heart condition at home December 3, 1951.  He is buried at the Havens Cemetery north of the end of Old Kelley Rd. east of highway 57 north of Vancleave.  Black and white neighbors attended his funeral.
