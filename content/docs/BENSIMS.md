Ben was born in 1783 in SE North Carolina.  He was the son of Robert Sims who lived in Bladen Co., NC in 1800.  His father died about 1806.

In 1810 he was the head of a household in Bladen Co., NC.  His mother, Elizabeth Lowe, a widow, lived with him.

He married Narcissa ________ (b. 1793 in NC) about 1815 in North Carolina.  She never learned to read or write.

In 1820 Ben was enumerated in the census of Columbus Co., NC with his wife, Narcissa, a son under 10, and a daughter under 10.  One was engaged in agriculture.  They resided next door to the William Sims household from which William was absent.  Only William's wife and six children were listed.  William was probably Ben's brother.

About 1825? the family moved to southwest Alabama.

Narcissa and Ben's known children were:

- Sarah Sims (b. 1822; md. Drury D. Foster (b. 1816 in AL; a handicapped shoemaker)).
- Robert F. Sims (b. 1826 in AL ;(member Co. C, 22 AL Regmt.; killed in Civil War before Feb. 2, 1865); md. Susan Ellen Mozingo (b. May 16, 1829 in AL; d. Apr. 26, 1865; buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery, Choctaw Co., AL)).
- Ann M. Sims (b. 1827 in AL).
- Narcissa Sims (b. 1830 in AL; md. William R. Dunn (b. 1829 in AL; served in Co. C, 38th AL Infantry; d. before 1880); moved to Hill Co., TX about 1878?).

In the 1830 census there are three Benjamin Simses in Alabama.  The one residing in Wilcox County is probably our man.  (Wilcox County lies east of Marengo and Clarke Counties.)  The family included 1 son 5-10, Benjamin 40-50, 2 daughters under 5, one daughter 5-10 and Narcissa 30-40.

Benjamin Sims with Allen Robison served as witnesses to the will of Joseph Jenkins of Wilcox Co., AL on Feb 3, 1832.

Of the three Ben Simses enumerated in the 1840 census our Ben probably was the one in Washington Co., AL. (Today Washington Co. lies south of Choctaw Co.) The family included 1 son 10-15, Ben 60-70 (a mistake), 1 daughter 5-10, 1 daughter 10-15, 1 15-20 and Narcissa 40-50.  Of the family, two worked in agriculture.

Choctaw County was formed in 1847 from Sumter and Washington Counties.  In the 1850 census Ben and Narcissa lived there.  (If they lived in the part of Washington Co. that was split off, it's possible that they remained at the same farm as in 1840.)  Only their two youngest daughters remained at home.  They resided next door to his nephew William and Susan Hester Sims and their family.

Ben died in about 1855.

In 1860 Narcissa lived with her son Robert and his wife Susan and their children.  Their known children were: 

- Elizabeth Sims (b. 1849). 
- William B. Sims (b. 1851; 4 Nov 1875 md. Elizabeth Bozone (b. 1852 in AL)). 
- Robert W. Sims (b. 1853). 
- Thomas D. Sims (b. 1856). 
- Sarah Sims (b. 29 Apr 1859; d. 2 Sept 1935; md. Noah Stafford (d. 1926)).  

In 1870 Narcissa lived with her daughter Narcissa and her husband William Dunn and their six children.  

- William R. Dunn (b. 1854)
- Elvira Ann Dunn (b. May 21, 1856; d. Aug 31, 1942 in Dallas, TX; md. John R. Capps (b. July 1, 1854 in LA; d. May 27, 1926 in TX)).
- Samantha Dunn (b. 1860)
