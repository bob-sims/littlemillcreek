Gabriella was born April 8, 1841 (?) the fifth child and fourth daughter of Samuel Jackson Parr (b. Dec. 7, 1814) and Lusana Humphries Parr (b. May 1, 1818).  As the family lived in Oglethorpe Co., GA in 1840, that was most probably her birthplace. 

Born in Clarke Co, GA, Samuel was the tenth child and sixth son of Benjamin Parr and Martha Duncley "Patsy" McKinney Parr.  Benjamin (b. Sept 1, 1760 in Morris Co., NJ, the son of Matthias Parr) served in the Revolutionary War and married Patsy on July 25, 1790 in Wilkes Co., NC.  On June 1, 1840 he lived in Clarke Co, GA with E. H. Rodgers, possibly a son-in-law.  He applied for a Revolutionary War pension at that time.  He died Dec 22, 1842 in Carroll Co., GA.

Samuel married Lusana Feb 20, 1833 in Clarke Co., GA.  In the 1840 census he is listed (in Oglethorpe Co.) as a farmer who owned 6 slaves, 3 women that worked in the fields and 3 children.

Gabriella's mother, Lusana, died about 1843 (?).  Samuel married Elizabeth ____ about 1845, and the family moved to Barbour Co. in SE AL, (or he may have moved and then married.)

The 1850 census records Gabriella in Barbour Co, AL in the home of her stepmother, Elizabeth Parr (b. 1815 in GA).  Her brothers and sisters included: Nancy Ann Jane (b. Feb 9, 1834 in GA), Calvin Union (b. May 27, 1836, d. June 20, 1836), Martha Lusana (b. June 6, 1837 in GA), Mariah Terytory (b. Dec 1, 1839 in GA), George (b. 1846 in AL), and Janet (b. 1848 in AL).  Because Samuel is absent, I assume that he died about 1849.  No slaves are present.  Elizabeth Parr is apparently a widow with six children to support.  The family has gone from riches to rags.

According to S. N. Wilkins Biography of William Wilkins, Gabriella’s stepmother, Elizabeth died of consumption.

The orphan Gabriella was taken in by the Henry Wilkins family (according to Mrs. Jack Nixon).  In spite of adversity, somehow she learned to read and write.  The same generous family supported another orphan, William Nixon (b. Nov. 1829).

On September 2, 1856 Gabriella married William.

Her sister, Martha, on August 20, 1858, married Francis Marion Hasty in Henry Co., AL.

William and Gabriella had the following children: 

1) Calvin Greenberry Nixon (b. Aug 1857; 1883 md. Aura Ophelia Smith).
2) Henry Levi Nixon (b. 11 Nov 1859; d. 20 Feb 1940; 5 Mar, 1882 md. Eliza Jane Beard (b. 28 Feb 1864; d. 27 Oct 1929); had 9 children; lived in Batesville, MS).
3) Lany N. Nixon (b. July 1867; Dec 8, 1889 md. Edmund Raymond Junior Griffis).
4) Sallie Rebecca Nixon (b. May 1869; d. July 1,1946; Dec 15, 1886 md. Joseph Henry Cosby (b. Nov 1854 in VA)).
5) Bertha P. Nixon (b. Feb 1876; d. Feb 1905; Apr 8, 1894 md. Albert L. Snyder).
6) Mittie E. Nixon (b. Aug 1880; d. Dec 1913; Mar 9, 1899 md. Jesse L. McCullar (b. 1873; d. 1928); had 5 children.
7) Etta Nixon (died in infancy).

According to John Nixon, Jr. a descendant of Henry, one grandson remembered Gabriella as "a kindly old lady with silvery hair so long that when it was unbraided, she could sit on it!"

Sadly, Gabriella died January 5, 1916.  She is buried at Liberty Hill Cemetery in southern Panola Co.
