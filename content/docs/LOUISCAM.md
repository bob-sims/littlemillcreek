Born 1 May 1914, Louis was the fourth child of Vertie Lee and Andrew Campbell.  He was born at White Plains, a small community in Harrison Co., MS.  From childhood, he was called "Cotton" due to his blond hair.

In 1933 he graduated from Woolmarket High School where he was valedictorian of his class.  He was awarded the Balfour medal for his achievements.  Although he played football, at that time the school had no football team.

During the Summers Cotton worked with George Cruthirds at his dairy.  The dairy owned 30-40 cows, allowing them to milk 25-30 daily.  The cows were allowed to range and feed in the woods.  He and George would ride horses to check on and care for them.

He enrolled at Perkinston Junior College near Wiggins.  There he received a football scholarship.  He was an excellent player.

After graduation from Perk in 1935, he enrolled at Southern in Hattiesburg, majoring in science and math.  Because most small or rural schools could not hire a teacher for each subject, teachers needed two specialties.  He received a football scholarship and continued to play at Southern.  He graduated in 1939.

His first job was at Tylertown, MS, where he taught two years.  There he met a very pretty girl, Hilda Foil.

While teaching at Marks, MS, at midyear in 1942, Louis joined the navy.  He was trained in the "90 day wonder" program to become an ensign.  After a training course at the University of Illinois at Champlain-Urbana in diesel engine operation, he was stationed at San Diego, CA awaiting assignment to a ship.

On 6 Jan 1943 Cotton married Hilda Carametta Foil.  Born in Walthall Co, MS, 27 Jan 1918, she was the daughter of Maggie Mae Branton Foil and Nelson Richard Foil.  She obtained a degree from USM in home economics in 1942.

In April 1943, Louis departed from San Francisco to serve in the Pacific theater during the war.  Hilda returned to Tylertown.  She taught home economics in New Augusta, MS.

After the conclusion of the war in November 1945, he enrolled at George Peabody College in Nashville, TN.  (It developed into Vanderbilt University).  There he earned a Master's degree in education (M. Ed.).  He continued studying under Professor Wheeler.
His research topic was "Educational Administration as Social Policy".  In 1953 he was awarded an Ed. D. degree.

Louis and Hilda had 2 children:

1) Cynthia Campbell (b. 5 March 1949 in Tupelo, MS; md. N. M. "Mike" Brown (b. 7 Nov 1945); have 1 adopted son).
2) Andrew Campbell (b. 13 Sept 1952 in Nashville, TN; M. D.; in 2001 practices psychiatry in Dallas, TX).

His first college teaching was at Kentucky Wesleyan College, a Methodist school in Owensboro, KY.  He taught there six years.  Hilda worked there as supervisor of all school cafeterias.

Louis returned to teach at USM in Hattiesburg in 1960.  He first initiated and organized practice teaching there.  

After teaching for years, Cotton retired from USM in 1979.

For the 1979-80 school year, he served as Curriculum Director for the Jackson Co. School District.  He worked to improve instruction in the schools.

He and Hilda enjoyed traveling in a nice RV.  They made several extended trips including one to Alaska and another to Boston, MA.
They traveled 66,000 miles in their RV.  

About 1985 they sold their home in Hattiesburg and moved into a townhouse in Franklin, TN near Nashville.  They enjoy visits with their daughter Cynthia, her husband, Mike and their son in nearby Brentwood, TN.

They also took tours overseas.  In 1985 they went to Australia; in 1986 they traveled to London; in 1987 they toured London and Europe.

Unfortunately, he developed asthma.

In 1993 Louis and Hilda celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.

In 1997, Louis worked with the boy scouts and maintained a nice vegetable garden.

Sadly, in July, 2000 Hilda died of cancer rather soon after it was diagnosed.
