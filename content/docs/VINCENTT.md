Vincent was born Dec. 4, 1891 in Moss Point, MS, the youngest child of Antonio and Isabella Gaballin Torres.  He had six older brothers and three older sisters.  In 1900 the following children were present in the household: Tony J. (b. Mar 1871), Mary (b. Feb 1874), Theresa (b. Jan 1878, Joe (b. Apr 1880), Bella (b. Dec 1881), John (b. Mar 1886), Migille (a boy) (b. Dec 1887), and Vincent. 

His Dad, (b. Jan 1837) a native of Barcelona, Spain, was captain of a sea-going schooner.  He hauled goods such as casks of wine from the old world to the new.  He had 6 brothers who were also sea captains.  Several operated out of New Orleans.

His mother, (b. Nov 1851) a native of New Orleans, had an Italian father and a mother from New Orleans. (Natalin Gaballin, who placed his mark on their marriage license verifying that Bella was of age, was probably her father.)  Tony and Bella obtained their license Feb. 5, 1870.  They married in New Orleans and lived there until 1879 when they moved to Moss Point, MS.

Thereafter his Dad ran a packet steamboat between Moss Point and New Orleans.  In about 1900 there were 35 sawmills operating in Moss Point.  He hauled lumber from these to New Orleans.

Charles describes his grandmother as "four feet high and five feet wide".

In 1905, when Vincent was only 13, his dad died.  He is buried at Griffin Cemetery in Moss Point.  His older brother, Tony J. (b. 1871) also a steamboat captain, possibly served as his second father.

In 1911 the Southern Paper Co. began operation in Kreole, east of Moss Point on the Escatawpa or Dog River.  On April 6, 1913 Vincent began work there.  In June 1928 the International Paper Co. bought the mill and continued to operate it.  Vincent remained there.  He worked as an engineer in stock preparation.

Vincent served in the army during World War I.  He fought in the trenches in France.  Fortunately, he was not injured.  His son Charles has his discharge papers.

On January 1, 1920 he married Ester Maye Havens (b. July 24, 1895), the daughter of Bill and Dora Havens of Vancleave.  They met after she began teaching school in Escatawpa.  The ceremony was performed in her home.

The 1920 census records them living on Arthur St. in Moss Point.  Vincent's mother, Bella, his brother Tony, and his nephew Lawrence (age 19; his brother Louis's son) live with them.  The census taker visited on January 5, 1920, only 4 days after their marriage.

They made their home at 119 Dantzler St. in Moss Point.  

On Dec 31, 1935, Vincent's brother Tony J. died aged 64.

Although his parents and relatives were members of the Catholic Church, Vincent was never very active.  After his marriage he ceased any activity or affiliation with the Catholic Church.

Vincent actively supported and worked with the Volunteer Firemen in Moss Point.  Most mornings he went to the fire station.  When Vancleave wanted to improve its volunteer fire department, he gave Havens Fletcher, his nephew, some old firefighters magazines.  He enjoyed talking about advances in fire engines over the years.

He and May enjoyed fishing.  They kept a skiff with an outboard motor.  They fished in the Escatawpa River.

About 1947 (?) his mother died.

January 1, 1958, he retired from the mill, having worked there his entire adult life.

He received a pension check from the military for his World War I service.

Sadly, May died Dec. 16, 1981.

After Maye's death Mrs. Taylor was paid to care for Vincent, now 90 years old.  She prepared and served his meals.  After several years, when she could no longer take care of him, he was moved to a nursing home in Grand Bay, Ala.  After less than a week there Vincent died on August 31, 1987.

He is buried beside Maye at Griffin Cemetery in Moss Point.
