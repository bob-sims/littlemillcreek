William was born in 1851 in Choctaw Co., AL the second child of Robert F. Sims (b. 1826 in AL) and Susan Ellen Mozingo Sims (b. May 16, 1829 in AL).  His known grandparents were Benjamin & Narcissa Sims.

He had an older sister, Elizabeth (b. 1849), and younger siblings, Robert W. (b. 1853), Thomas D. (b. 1856) and Sarah Jane (b. Apr. 29, 1859; d. Sept. 2, 1939; buried at Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Choctaw Co., AL).  All were born in Alabama.

His father served in Company C of the 38th Alabama Regiment in the Civil War.  Tragically, he was killed before Feb. 2, 1865.  On that date his mother was listed as a widow in Civil War records in the National Archives.

A second tragedy struck when his mother died April 26, 1865.  The combination of the hardships and lack of food due to the war, disease due to poor nutrition, caring for her young children and grieving for her husband was more than she could bear.  She is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Choctaw Co.

William, Thomas & Sarah Jane were recorded August 10, 1870, in the federal census living with William & Francis Bozone and their family.  This same William Bozone family had lived next door to the Robert Sims family in 1860.  In 1870 none of the three children could read or write.  William worked as a farm laborer.

On June 16, 1871, William appeared before the Probate Court in Choctaw Co.  He nominated William Bozone to serve as guardian of him and his brother and sister.  The court granted the request.

On November 4, 1875 he married Elizabeth Bozone (b. 1856 in MS), daughter of Samuel & Nancy Bozone.  They were married at her parent's residence.

January 24, 1876, William was able to recover 286 1/4 acres of land by bidding $150 at public auction.  This was land that his father had owned.  William, Thomas and Sarah Jane owned it as tenants in common prior to this sale.   It was described as "broken piney woods lands" with a log cabin and 8 to 10 cleared acres "now grown up in pines" (Probate Inventory, Book B, p. 120).  William paid cash.  It's impressive that a newly married man, orphaned as a boy, would have saved this much money.  The men who handled the auction claimed about $64 as costs.  The remainder of the price bid, about $86 was divided equally among the Sims heirs, William, Thomas and Sarah Jane.

William and Elizabeth's known children include:

Susan E. Sims (b. Aug 1877)
Nancy Roena Sims (b. Aug 9, 1879; never md.; d. Sept. 19, 1968; buried at Salem Church Cemetery, Wayne Co., MS)
Robert Samuel Sims (b. Sept. 29, 1881; d. May 6, 1975 of uremia; buried at Fedora Cemetery, Wayne Co., MS; md. Willie M. _____ (b. Dec 11, 1899)
Thomas D. Sims (b. Sept 1885)
William B. Sims (b. Feb. 1888)

Tragically, five infant children of W. B. and Elizabeth Sims are buried at Pleasant Hill Cemetery, according to Mary Ellen Tindle (p. 132).  Their names are unknown.  Confirmation is provided by the 1900 census which reports that Elizabeth gave birth to 11 children only 5 of which were then living.  Elizabeth's parents Samuel and Nancy Bozone are buried nearby in that same cemetery.  

On Sept. 24, 1878, his sister Sarah Jane and Noah Lott Stafford (b. Oct 16, 1855; d. May 6, 1926; son of Ezekiel (b. 1807) and Alcy Ann Chandler Stafford (b. 1827)) applied for a marriage license at the court house (Book 1, p. 230).  They were married.  According to the federal census of 1910, Sarah had had 9 children, 8 of whom where living at that time.  Their children included:

Thomas E. C. Stafford (b. 1879; d. 1942; md. Trudie Bozone (b. 1884 in AL); had 4 sons & 5 daughters).
David G. Stafford (b. Feb 19, 1883; d. June 11, 1958; 1910 md. Olivia _____ Wilson, a widow (b. 1887); had at least 2 sons & 2 daughters).
Erin Stafford (a girl; b. 1893; md. Jesse F. Porter).
Clyde S. Stafford (b. Dec 23, 1895; d. Aug 27, 1967; md. Maude Wright (b. Oct 24, 1901 in AL)).
William Stafford (b. 1899; md. Ollie Land).
Jesse Stafford (b. 1901; md. 1) _____ Moseley; 2) Stella Mae Andrews).
Amanda Elizabeth Stafford "Babs" (md. Willie Wilson).
Ellen Stafford (md. Cicero Martin).

Sarah Jane's great granddaughter, Letha Mathews Hodges, remembers being held on her lap.  She played by pretending to make biscuits with the young child.

In the 1880 federal census (recorded June 15, 1880) William is described as a farmer.  He and Elizabeth and their two oldest children lived next door to her brother Samuel Bozone and his young family.

They bought 40 acres of land (in Section 9, Township 16, Range 2 West) from G. W. and M. A. David on April 1, 1882.  They paid $200.

They bought 25 acres (in Section 15, Township 10, Range 2 West) from William and Francis Bozone on Dec 7, 1882.  Again they paid $200.

In the federal census of 1900 (recorded 1 June 1900) William was listed as a farmer.  He owned his farm at Womack Hill free of any mortgage.  All of the boys worked as farm laborers.  Both he and his wife and all the children could read and write.

William & Elizabeth sold land to Mary Boney.  This sale was filed in court house records on Feb 20, 1904 (Deed Book 2, p. 142).  They sold land to J. T. Johnson in a transaction filed Jan 2, 1905 (Book 2, p. 232 or 237).

About 1905 they moved west to Wayne Co., MS. 

In personal tax rolls for 1907 both William and his oldest son, Bobbie, are listed in Enon, MS.  In 1908 they appear in the Frost Bridge community.  William owns 8 cows with a value of $60; 2 mules valued at $200; and 1 piano, organ or melodion valued at $25.  In addition he has 2 cows classed as exempt property.  His total personal tax was $1.71.  In 1909 he possessed 7 cows ($35), 2 mules ($175), 2 wheeled vehicles (carriages, bicycles, etc.; $30), 1 piano, organ or melodion ($25) and a watch ($5).  His tax bill was $1.62.

In both the censuses of 1910 and 1920 William is listed as a Wayne Co. farmer who owns his farm.  Throughout this period Bobbie, who remained unmarried until later, lived with them.  According to the personal tax rolls, he owned a mule.  He worked as a farmer with his dad.

Sadly, William died 23 April 1931 of heart problems.  Dr. W. R. Gray attended him.  Elizabeth died Apr. 18, 1934.  Both are buried at Salem Church (or Frost Bridge) Cemetery in Wayne Co., MS.
