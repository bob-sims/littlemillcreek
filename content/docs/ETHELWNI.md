Ethel was born in March 1903 the oldest child of Ada Gunter Walters (b. 1886 in MS) and Marshall Walters (b. 1879 in MS).

The 1910 census (recorded 18 Apr 1910) listed her as 6 and her brother Houston as 4.  Although her dad was employed, no occupation was given for him.  The family rented a house (not a farm) in Jones Co. MS.

Tragically, her dad died shortly after that census while she was a child.

On 20 Dec 1916 (or 1918) she married Alonzo Nixon (b. March 25, 1896), the son of Calvin and Ophelia Smith Nixon.  They lived for several years with his parents.

In 1920, the federal census records them in the household of Calvin and Ophelia in Jones Co.  Lon is described as a teamster who worked hauling.

Sadly, on 6 Apr 1935, Ethel had a baby boy that was born dead.  It was her only child.

Ethel worked as a practical nurse.  She was employed first at the Jackson Co. hospital in Pascagoula.  She worked shifts.  Beginning in 1948 she worked at the Lucedale hospital.  She retired about 1956.

Ethel was a good cook.  Her nieces and nephews particularly enjoyed her famous big biscuits.

She grew beautiful yard flowers.  The clay soil south of Lucedale made dahlias prosper.  She supported tall stalks heavy with blooms by tying them to stakes.
   
Lon died suddenly of a heart attack in July 1959.  They were staying at Lon's sister Idell's house in Pascagoula.  Idell was hospitalized there.

Ethel was stricken with grief and heart-broken.  Having married so young she lost both her "father" and her husband.  She moved to Alabama to be near her brother Houston Walters.

Later she moved to Florida to manage a trailer park owned by her relatives at 777 N. Beal Parkway in Fort Walton Beach.  For several years she lived in a trailer there.

Her health gradually deteriorated.  Sadly, she died in a nursing home in Florida in November 1982.  She is buried beside Lon in the Lucedale cemetery.
