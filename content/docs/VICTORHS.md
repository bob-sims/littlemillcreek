Victor was born September 22, 1908 in Eastabutchie, MS, the second child and second son of Waldo and Idell Nixon Sims.  Dr. Gardner delivered the baby.

About 1911 the family moved to Carson in Jeff Davis Co.  Waldo ran a cotton gin there for one year.  While in Carson Victor developed a serious case of whooping cough.

Late in 1911 the family moved to Moselle in Jones Co.

Not long after they arrived in Moselle, his uncle, Iggie Sims, gave the boys a wild black nannie goat.  She had twin nannie kids, one black and one white.  Victor claimed the white one.  The goats ate corn and spilled cottonseed.  From these first nannies by 1920 30-40 goats had descended.  One of Victor's favorites was a goat named Bill.  Their neighbors, the Hunleys took him with them when they moved to Union, MS.  They trained him.  Later when they moved back next door, Victor reclaimed Bill.  

During the Summer of 1914 Victor recalls riding in a one seated black buggy without a top with his mother and brother and sister to Hattiesburg.  He was impressed by the hollow plunk sound the horse hooves made on wood as they crossed bridges.  They took "Prince" to the livery stable on Main Street east of the court house.  The horse was unhitched, haltered and lead into a stall with water and hay.  Idell shopped for cloth, buttons and fruit.

At about age 6 he remembers Uncle Iggie and Uncle Solie, his Dad's brothers, taking the children to a circus.  The Sparks Circus and Cels Floto Circus came by train to town.  The wild animals rode in circus wagons atop flat cars on the train.  Beside the train horses pulled each wagon guided by a circus hand steering the wagon tongue to the end of the string of flatcars where they were lead down a ramp.  The circus featured lions, tigers, monkeys, chimpanzees, mandrels, polar bears, giraffes, elephants and ostriches.  They displayed snakes in the side show.

For publicity they staged a circus parade.  With the band playing, the circus wagons with their curtains tied up displayed the exotic animals.  One wagon featured a beautiful woman with jewels riding with inoffensive animals.  One mystery wagon had its curtains rolled down.  A calliope added merriment.  The first calliope was fired by a steam boiler.  If a wagon became mired in mud, elephants pulled it out.

The circus operated 2 or 3 rings under a large tent with collapsible bleacher seating.  Vendors sold hot dogs and cotton candy.  One act featured 7 - 9 pigs.  They climbed a slide and slid down!  One pig dressed in a clown suit disrupted a school while a man danced to "Dixie"!

About 1916 he developed a severe toothache.  Waldo took him on the train from Moselle to Hattiesburg to Dr. Busby.  This was before dentists used x-rays.  Dr. Busby pulled a jaw baby tooth.

In 1918 his Dad bought him his first bicycle, a used blue "Pathfinder" from Mr. Wells.  The 26" wheels had solid tubular tires with wooden rims.  Unlike Bruce's first bike, this one had atherton coaster brakes.
  
In 1920 the family moved to Seminary in Covington Co.

Until he was about 12 his mother cut his hair.  Thereafter he went to the barbershop.  Estus King owned the shop in Seminary.  Rhodie Rankin shined shoes there and operated a steam pressing shop.  Men could rent a room beside the barber shop with a shower in which to clean up.

Mr. "Shortie" Jones from Collins operated a food stand from a 10' x 12' tin building.  He sold creme soda and grape and orange sodas.  Hamburgers were thin 2 1/2" beef patties on small buns with mustard and chopped onions.  They sold for 5 cents!

For $3 he bought a used Hopkins & Allen single barrel 12 guage shotgun from Jesse Carter.  It had a 30" barrel.  After he repaired it, he hunted larks and doves, squirrels and rabbits.  Most of their hunting was during the day, but occasionally they hunted rabbits at night with a carbide light that fitted into a bracket on their cap.

Victor's first fine teacher was Miss Vasiti Spell from Mt. Olive.  She had blonde hair and wore glasses.  She taught him 8th grade math at Seminary.  Not only was she an excellent teacher, she was a fine person.

In the Spring of either 1922 or 1923 Mr. Caleb Welch had borrowed Waldo's horse Raleigh (the same horse Uncle Solie called Spot) to plow his 2-3 acre cotton field.  To repay Waldo, he took Bruce and Victor on an all day trip to New Orleans.  The 4 am train arrived about 7 am in New Orleans.  After a breakfast of hot cakes, maple syrup and sausage at the Deluxe Cafe, they saw the sights.  They went to the Cabildo; they visited Audubon Park.  It had impressive aquaria with large fish.  The highlight of the day was attending a professional baseball game between New Orleans and Cincinnati.  Triss Speaker, then white-headed, played for Cincinnati and hit a run.  They caught the train home about 9 pm.

About 1922 Seminary built a new school building.  While construction was underway, classes met in houses around town.  The new schoolhouse was a one story, frame structure in the shape of a letter "H".  Two classroom wings with about 4 classrooms each and a hall down one side were connected by a central auditorium, the "cross-piece" in the "H".  All grades held classes here.

The school had a carbide light system, a good system.  A smaller barrel was inverted inside a water-containing larger barrel.  A hopper above the smaller barrel contained crushed stone made of calcium carbide.  A trigger released carbide into water in the inner barrel.  This generated acetylene gas, the fuel, that was collected by a pipe and piped from the generator in a shed in the school yard to ceiling fixtures in the classrooms.  The fixtures had nozzles with two tips directed toward each other that produced a flat, flared flame to provide light.
 
There were two outdoor toilets for girls and two for boys.  One was intended for younger children and one for older.  Each had 6 to 8 seats.  Toilet paper was provided.  Tubs beneath the seats collected wastes.  Regularly Mr. Gene Booze, a black man, came with his team carrying barrels on his wagon to empty the waste tubs.  He provided clean tubs and transported the wastes to dump them in a field north of town.  (His brother, Warren Booze, was the right-hand man in Hemeter's Merchantile Co. Store in Seminary.)

School began at 8:30 am in the morning.  There were one hour periods with a 15 minute morning and afternoon recess and a break for lunch.  There was a well with a pump suppling water, but no cafeteria.  Students who brought their lunches ate on benches on campus.  Victor went home for lunch across the street.  School was dismissed at 3:30 pm. 

Students used cedar pencils with small erasers sharpened by a hand cranked pencil sharpener.  "Big 5" brand lined paper tablets were popular.  Students bought their books.  They were good hardback volumes with black and white pictures.  However some of the teachers did not teach.  In 1923 Victor's algebra teacher who was also principal and basketball coach took the basketball team off for a trip.  He got drunk and the students suffered.  Victor learned no algebra that year and so repeated the ninth grade.

Students received cream-colored report cards.  Victor's dad and aunts encouraged him to read. By 1922-23 he had read books by Victor Hugo and Mark Twain on his own.  His reading helped him excel in history.  He was always exempt from exams in history.  He earned A's in history, B's in science and C's in math and English. 

About 1924 Mr. Homer J. Kraft, an exWWI machine gunner, became principal at Seminary.  He bought the school's first encyclopedia, a set of red-backed Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia and a set of green-backed World Book Encyclopedia.  These were constantly used by the students.

One year after his arrival he hired Mr. Vernon Dykes, the school's first coach and Victor's second excellent teacher.  About 35 years old, Mr. Dykes came from near Magnolia, MS.  He had graduated from Mississippi College.  He taught sciences including chemistry.  With $1000 from the school he bought a kit of science equipment.  It included a bell jar, a pump and electrical components that allowed him to perform a variety of demonstrations for his science classes.  He taught Victor single phase, alternating current electricity.

Victor performed demonstrations of science principles at chapel in school. 

He played football the first year Mr. Dykes was there.  The Seminary school had bought uniforms from another school that had discontinued its team.

From Scribner's Lumber and Log Book Victor found a recipe for leather dressing that he prepared for use on harnesses.  First 1.5-2 qts. of beef tallow rendered to liquify it and remove fiber is mixed over low heat with 1 lb. still resin (or fiddle bow resin).  One to 1.5 lbs. of beeswax is added and stirred in.  Finally, add 1 pt. neatsfoot oil (from calves), remove from heat and stir continuously until the mixture cools and solidifies.  This makes leather soft and pliable.

In 1926 he made home-brew beer.  It was made from malt, sugar, yeast cakes and water to make 5 gallons.  His Dad really enjoyed it.

About 1926 Waldo got a 1925 Star soft-top touring car in repayment of a debt.  He gave it to Victor.  Painted black, it had 4 cylinders.  The first owner had run over a stump with it and twisted the drive shaft and the transmission.  Victor repaired it.  He mended the cloth top with black strips that fitted over the frame that supported the top.
 
The carbide light system at the school was replaced by a Delco light plant about 1926.  A one cylinder engine powered a 32 volt, DC generator.  Then electricity arrived in Seminary about 1928.

Victor helped Dick Morris set up the diesel generator that produced the electricity.  The electricity powered an ice plant.  Ice was made by an ammonia process.

By selling a bale of cotton, Victor earned $45.  In the Summer of 1927 he went to New Orleans hoping to get a job on a ship bound for Central America.  It was not easy.  After he failed to get hired, in July he rode the train to Galveston, TX to look for ship work.  
The Southern Pacific train crossed the Mississippi River on a ferry in 3-4 car sections with 4 sets of tracks.  At that time the river was in flood.  Two tugs moved the ferry across the river at night.  The tugs signaled each other with bells and whistles.  Clusters of pilings anchored the landing dock where the tugs had to line up the tracks on the ferry with those on the dock.  Amazingly, they accomplished this in the dark with only two kerosene lanterns on the dock!

Having no luck in Galveston after a week he returned to New Orleans.  Back in New Orleans he stayed at the Warrington House at 1140 Royal St.  This time his persistence was rewarded and he was hired by the United Fruit Co. agent to work as an ordinary seaman aboard the SS Tela on its maiden voyage.  Built in Belfast, Ireland, it was over 400' long powered by a 5000 hp quadruple expansion engine.  Oil was its fuel.  It traveled at 22 knots (25 mph).  Bound for Port Aberas, Guatemala, it made one stop at Belize, British Honduras.  It's southbound cargo was about 60 passengers, mostly priests, and mail.  It's northbound cargo for the return trip to New Orleans was bananas and tons of coffee beans in sacks.

Victor worked in a crew of 12 to care for the ship.  Most of the crew had come with the ship from Ireland, Scotland and England.  Early every morning they scrubbed the deck.  They wore ordinary clothes and slept in tiers of cots about 2 feet apart.

Victor recalled two friends from the crew.  Charles Campbell from Chicago worked in the engine room.  It was so very hot there that he suffered.  George A. Foster, a black man, was linen stewart.  A very large man, he graduated from and became director of St. Augustine Mission House, a home for orphan and wayward people in Bay St. Louis, MS.  Victor corresponded with him after his return.

On shore in Guatamala, he ate ripe pineapples with juice like syrup.

After arriving at Port Aberas, the ship anchored out in the harbor for about 5 days.  To load the bananas, they moved up to the dock.  The grass green banana stalks were up to 5 ft. high.  They were loaded from the margin of the hull inward.  As an area was filled numbered posts were placed into numbered sockets in the floor and ceiling with planks to form open cages.  This produced 12' x 12' compartments.  Because they had no refrigeration for the fruit, they disembarked immediately when loading was completed.

En route home the bananas were checked daily for any signs of ripening.  Any stalk that began to turn yellow was tossed overboard to prevent others ripening.  Tiny, 6" hairless baby monkeys squeeled among the bananas.

The return trip lasted 4 days and 4 nights.  His total pay was $25.  Back in New Orleans he returned to Mr. Warrington's.  For $2 he was able to buy the return portion of a roundtrip train ticket to Hattiesburg from the head porter at the Southern Depot.

Principal Kraft instituted a requirement of Latin for graduation.  Each student had to complete 2 years of Latin.  Victor took one year from Mrs. Vera Lott Cranford, the sister of two classmates, Hershel and Clyde Lott.  He ordered a Latin book from Sears Roebuck.  Called a "Jack" book, it listed English-Latin equivalents.

For his second year of Latin Victor went to Perkinston the Summer of 1928.  Miss Martin (?) taught it.

In the fall of 1928 when Victor was a senior he took his entire class in his Star to Mt. Olive to visit Miss Spell, their eighth grade math teacher.  She was delighted.

Victor graduated in May (?), 1929. The graduates mailed invitations to friends and family members.  Mr. Fred Todd, Lottie's husband, gave Victor two $5 gold pieces; Mr. Jones, the former law school dean from Ohio State University, gave him a set of books: The Life and History of George Washington by Henry Cabot Lodge.  His class included 6 other young men (Tom W. Cooley, Earl Q. Beasley, Hershel L. Lott, Clyle C. Lott, Earl Speed and George G. Hemeter).  The graduates wore wine-colored caps and gowns for an indoor ceremony at night.  Each read a piece to contribute to the program.  

In the Fall of 1929 he enrolled in State Teacher's College - now University of Southern Mississippi- in Hattiesburg and attended classes for one year.

For the Summer of 1930 he worked on the construction of a gas pipeline.  A 16" line, it was being built from Louisiana eastward toward Mobile.  Victor stayed with the work until it reached Ovette, too far to easily commute.  From this job he saved $40, not enough to pay his second year college fees.

About that time a young man arrived in Seminary with a brokedown 1928 Harley motorbike.  He was trying to return to his home in Champaign, Illinois.  New the bike cost about $800 and he wanted to sell it for $400.  Victor bargained with him and took him to the railroad depot.  For $36 he could buy a ticket on the IC railroad home.  About 4 pm by knocking on the bank door Mr. Mangrum opened the door and withdrew Victor's funds.  Victor now owned a green motorbike with a gold stripe.  

It featured a 74 cu. inch engine, an automatic oil pump and this was the first year for both front and rear brakes.  It had a 2 gallon and a spare, one gallon, gas tank.  It travelled 56 miles on a gallon of fuel.  But first, repairs were required.  The armature in the generator was burned out, and the tires and chains were worn out.  Victor hitched a ride to Jackson where he bought a new armature for $9.

When he got a job on a pipeline construction crew in California, he stored his bike in a crib in the barn and nailed planks across the front to secure it.  As it weighed more than 300#, it was not simple to lift it out.  He and Bill Blackwell departed on August 30, 1930 for the west coast.  They drove Bill's 1924 Essex, a two door car built by the Hudson Motor Co.  They tried to maintain a speed of 40 mph driving straight through.

On the California job he spent his first paycheck and saved all the rest.  After working there 10 months, they drove home.  Victor had saved $900.

In 1930 the family had moved to Hattiesburg.  Waldo rented the Kennedy building across from the Methodist Hospital where Bruce operated a Standard Oil Service station.  The economic conditions doomed it.  The family lived in a 7 room house there.  Victor's bike was waiting in the end of the hall.  He purchased new tires, tubes, chains and sprockets.  That made it as good as new.

About June 1931 he mailed Coyne Electric School in Chicago $225 to register for their standard 12 week electrical course. (His cousin, Cecil Horton, had attended Coyne.)  He rode his bike through Arkansas and Oklahoma northward to St. Louis, MO.  He crossed the Mississippi River there paying 10 cents toll!  In Chicago he stayed first at the YMCA; then he rented a hotel room and then he shared rooms with Frank Maserneock, a fellow student at Coyne, a German who had emigrated to Canada and worked in New York City.  Each paid $12 a week for about 10 weeks for their rooms.  A gas stove there allowed them to cook their own meals.  

Victor loved the school.  The instructors were very knowledgeable, impressive men.  More than 100 students were enrolled there.  The course was divided into about 4 departments.  Students worked independently on 16-18 jobs in each department.  The first department, the Primary department, included wiring push-button switches, lights, 16 volt electricity and finally they installed a telephone.  An instructor checked each job and punched your sheet.  The second department, the Construction department taught wiring houses and troubleshooting problems in wiring.  The third department, Motor winding and the final department, DC work and AC work completed the course.  On written tests they had to draw wiring diagrams.

Victor remained two additional weeks: one for automotive electricity and one for motor winding.  He received a diploma.

In 1932 the family moved to Jackson Co.  Waldo bought a farm north of Vancleave off Old River Road on what is now Sims Mill Pond Rd.

With Bruce's help he put down a water well beside the back porch of the house.  The 30 ft. well supplied water to a hand pump on the porch.  Extra water fell into a wooden box (a tight 10" deep bee-gum) connected by an underground pipe to a water trough for livestock at the side of the barn lot.

Victor built a water mill in front of the house place.  Long before a mill had been there, but pines had grown up and the dam had washed out.  Dr. Downing, a chiropractor, wrote the formula for construction of a case for the water wheel.  It was a 21" diameter turbine wheel on a 3" shaft.  Victor built a chute from heart cypress and oak.  A cylinder of water rolled inside the chute and struck the blade of the wheel turning it.  The wheel rested on a mushroom shaped lighterd knot about 12" high.  Because the wheel was a left hand wheel, the belt was twisted to correctly turn the stones.  

In 1933 Bruce and Victor either captured a wild swarm of honey bees or Leonard White gave them a swarm.  They built standard cypress hive boxes each holding 10 frames.  Victor checked the hives every other day or so.  Using homemade beekeeping veils made from window screen and a smoker fueled with pine straw, he removed the lid and inspected colonies that looked poorly.  The smoke suffocated the bees reducing their activity.  

Rarely he encountered wax moths in a hive.  The caterpillars ate bees' wax.  Tightly made hive boxes kept moths out.  Rarely a colony was nonproductive due to a poor queen.  He killed such queens and added a frame of young from another colony, so workers could tend a new queen.  Once a working bee colony was completely destroyed by a marauder that ate the wax and honey.  The villian was their young stallion Selum!

Worker bees collected nectar in the swamp from tupelo gum trees, holly trees, and titi blooms, but the major source was wild gall berry that lasted 3-4 weeks in Summer.  In flight, bees loaded with nectar have drooping abdomens.

Hives were robbed whenever the supers were full of honey.  The caps were cut from wax cells in two frames of comb that were placed in a mechanical extractor.  When it spun, centrifugal force separated the honey from the comb.  The honey was emptied by a spout into a bucket or jar.  Extra care was taken to avoid any exposure of honey to water or moisture.  Honey contaminated with water will spoil.  They removed from 100 to 300 lbs of honey from each colony.  The average yield was 100 lbs.  Because a bee must consume 6 lbs of honey to produce 1 lb of comb, old comb is recycled.  The caps were melted to provide beeswax.

They progressed from that one colony to 40 colonies by about 1938.  His best yield was 300lb from one hive with 3 supers in one year.  (In 1996 the average yield for a hive of bees in Mississippi is 80lb a year!) 

Victor collected 3-gallon jars from various stores to hold honey.  He sold it to the Electric Maid Bakery in Biloxi.  They operated two other bakeries in LA.  He provided all the honey needed for all 3 stores yearround.  They paid about $.50 a gallon.

In a time of hardship and economic depression, beekeeping was pleasant work that produced good food.

He would take the wagon into the woods to gather lighterd "pitch pine" to start fires in the fireplace.

He made tree poison from the following recipe:
Dissolve 2 lbs of Red Devil lye in 1 gallon water.
After it has cooled, add 1 lb. white arsenic, a powder obtained from a druggist.
This produced a brown (root-beer colored) liquid mixture.  Victor girdled sweet gum trees around the mill pond and squirted this poison into the cuts.  The poison was so strong that in one week one inch limbs would fall out of a 12" poisoned trees.  After 2 weeks, the 4-6" top of the tree would come down.  Thereafter the trunk fell in sections.  He poisoned unwanted trees as a source of firewood and never had to chop the tree down!  Root sprouts did not grow from poisoned trees. 

In Jackson County he made vinegar from ripe pears.  The fruit was packed in a 3 gallon crock tightly covered with a double layer of cloth.  Several weeks later when the vinegar smell appeared, he siphoned off the vinegar.  This was done carefully so as not to break-up a crust of floating crud.  Clear amber vinegar resulted.  The bottles were corked. 

In April 1938 Victor married Inez Havens (b. August 21, 1916), youngest daughter of Bill and Dora Havens of Vancleave.  Rev. Rob Vaughn performed the ceremony.

After Inez had a serious reaction to a honeybee sting, Victor sold his bees to Walter Orange.  He took bees to Minnesota every Spring.

He began work at the Electrical department at Ingalls Shipbuilding in 1941.  His boss, Pat Murphy, listed Victor as one of his key employees and told the Draft Board that he couldn't run the shipyard without them.  Victor was placed in charge of the cranes.  He worked there until 1950 when he quit.

That same year he began to work on construction at International Paper Co. in Kreole.  They built a new powerhouse and the large no. 5 papermachine.  The powerhouse makes electricity from bark and principally oil and spent liquor containing resin from papermaking.
After 1.5 years on construction, he transferred to operating electrician and working swing shifts.

In 1950 he joined the Pascagoula Masonic Lodge #419, becoming a third degree mason.  Mr. Louis F. Kramer, a neighbor, was secretary when he joined.

In August 1969 hurricane Camille struck the Mississippi Gulf coast.  Victor and Elnora evacuated to Reg and Verlie Green's old home east of highway 57 in southern George Co. (Reg and Verlie delayed leaving too long and were forced to remain at their house in Moss Point.)  The storm fury followed them across George Co.  Trees were blown down across their entry lane.  Victor had taken an axe and the chain saw for such an eventuality.  In clearing the logs from the lane, he broke a toe.  At age 60, he broke his first bone!

After illness, he retired from International Paper Co. July 1, 1971.
