Born July 30, 1850, Calvin was the oldest son of St. Cyr (pronounced Sancher or Sancere) Seymour and Anna Margaret McCarthy Seymour.  Calvin was born at Latimer.  According to the 1910 census,  his father was born in Mississippi, but his mother was born in England.

April 5, 1873 he married Elizabeth Mulholland.  Elizabeth was only 13 at this time.  She was born June 29, 1859 of Irish parents, James and Elizabeth Rhyn (or Ryan) Mulholland.  The 1910 census reports that she was born in Mississippi; family legend reports that she was born in Ireland and the family emigrated in 1865 to Mississippi.

Elizabeth was a tall, stout, blue-eyed woman, according to her granddaughter, May Torres.

They had the following children:

1) Annie Delorean "Dora" Seymour (b. Jan 21, 1874; d. Aug 16, 1965; 1894 md. Wm. R. Havens).
2) Clara Leanead "Nead" Seymour (b. Dec 28, 1875; md. W. A. "Andy" Stone; lived in Walters, OK).
3) James Seymour (b. Feb. 18, 1878).
4) Cora Mary Seymour (b. July 19, 1879).
5) Edgar Peter Seymour (b. Dec 16, 1880; d. Dec. 15, 1943; md. 1) Ida Quave, 2) Agnes Boney).
6) Carmelious "Camille" Seymour (b. Apr. 10, 1883; d. Mar 15, 1945; md. Daisy Caldwell (b. Jan 2, 1888; d. Apr. 22, 1966)).
7) Joseph Jefferson "Jeff" Seymour (b. July 4, 1885; d. Jan. 1, 1902).
8) Rose Elizabeth Seymour (b. Sept. 9, 1889).
9) Nora May Seymour (b. 1890 ?; d. July 2 ?, 1914 in New Orleans; June 6, 1912 md. Adolf Hunt).
10) Agnes Cleo Seymour (b. Nov 7, 1894; d. Apr. 19, 1918; Nov 15, 1911 md. Pat Barthes (b. 1891)).

On March 26, 1880, he bought 40 acres of land (section 13, township 6 south, range 9 west) from the government.  He paid $.25 an acre or $10 for it!

The federal census, recorded April 2, 1910, lists him as a farmer.  Calvin is 60; Elizabeth , 51; their daughters, Nora L., 19 and Cleo, 15.  According to that document, Elizabeth had had 9 children with 6 still living.  That does not agree with other records.
In 1918 after Cleo's death, Calvin and Lizzie raised her daughters, Lucille (b. 1914?) and Nona Barthes (b. Jan 4, 1913; d. Jan 2, 1987).

They lived in a nice two story house with an outside staircase.  There were 6 rooms downstairs and 2 upstairs.  Originally the kitchen and dining room were in a separate rear building.  A covered walk connected the kitchen with the main house.  

Calvin farmed.  They kept chickens.  He grew sugar cane and had a cane mill where they made cane syrup.

At the beginning of a meal, the plates were stacked in front of Calvin.  He served the plates without asking what you wanted.  Each child cleaned their plate.

Calvin had a weakness for moonshine.  He would go off to an empty house for several weeks and drink.  After a while without eating, he would come home.

"Calvin was a good man.  If he could help anyone, he did it," according to his great niece, Lillian Curry.  As was the custom when visitors were ready to leave, he gave them a gift, a can of syrup or some smoked meat.

He was a talker.  Her family members would tease Lillian by calling her Calvin when she talked a lot!

The family boarded school teachers in their home.

Lizzie loved to eat fresh water perch.

In 1920 the census recorded 4 Feb 1920 lists Calvin, Elizabeth, their two granddaughters Nona and Lucille Barthes. Calvin's brother, Beauregard Seymour, a laborer, lived with them.

According to May Graham, her niece, Elizabeth would sit and tat, making lace with a triangular shuttle for pillowcases, or handkerchiefs or doilies, and share memories with her grandchildren.

Calvin was sick for some time before he died December 15, 1922.  His obituary appeared in "The Daily Herald" December 16.  His death certificate gives chronic nephritis as his cause of death.  He was buried at the Seymour Cemetery on a sunny hill north of Ocean Springs on the Jim Ramsey Cutoff Rd.

Sadly, Elizabeth suffered from uterine cancer.  However, a heart attack killed her April 11, 1936.  She rests beside Calvin.
