Idell was born Dec 9, 1888, the oldest child of Calvin and Aura Ophelia Smith Nixon.  She was born in Panola Co., MS.

As the oldest in the family as she reached her teen years, she helped care for her younger brothers and sisters.

In 1905 she married Epaminondas Waldo Sims (b. May 20, 1880), son of Robert and Elizabeth Sims.

Idell and Waldo had three children:

1) Robert Bruce Sims (b. July 10, 1906; d. Apr 25, 1984; md. Annie Lucille Lott (b. Mar 15, 1912; d. Nov 19, 1990).
2) Victor Hugo Sims (b. Sept. 22, 1908; md. 1) Inez Havens (b. Aug. 21, 1916; d. June 21, 1959), 2) Elnora King Breland (b. Aug 5, 1920).
3) Grace Sims (b. May 10, 1910; md. Louis P. McCaffrey (b. 1904; d. Nov 11, 1990).

The family raised a foster child, Margaret Sims (b. 1916; d. 10 April 1961; md. 1) Marvin E. Vaughn; divorced; 2) Bernie Keifer).

About 1919 the first gas pump was installed in Seminary.  The Standard Oil Company operated it.  The same store sold kerosene.  Many families used kerosene stoves made of thin steel.  For a while Idell cooked on one.  Each of its 4 eyes had a round, cotton wick.  It had a movable oven that you could place above the eyes.

She developed fine skills as a seamstress.  Over the years she made many garments for family members.  

She also enjoyed needlework, in particular, crocheting.  All the pillowcases were trimmed with handwork.  She made many centerpieces and lovely white or ecru tablecloths and bedspreads.  Using wool thread, she crocheted several afghans made by connecting colorful granny squares with dark thread. 

Sadly, Waldo developed stomach and pancreatic cancer.  To obtain care for him, they moved to Pascagoula in 1946.  Idell remained there after his death in May of that year.

In about 1951 she moved into the house at 3006 Canty St. in Pascagoula.  Initially she rented the north front room to a boarder.  John Griffin, a veteran of the pow camps of WWII and an Ingalls Shipbuilding employee, was one of her boarders.  Later Bruce and Victor added a kitchen to complete an apartment on the north side of the house.  Rent from it supplimented her income.  Bill and Christina Fletcher Swift lived in the apartment for a while.

Idell planted flowers including Easter lilies and amaryllis in the yard.  She cultivated a vegetable garden in the sloping backyard.  She called it, "the lower forty".

After a month of hospitalization with a heart condition, she died Sunday July 26, 1959 at 8:20 pm.  The funeral was conducted at the chapel of the Jackson Co. Mortuary by Rev. Aubrey Walley, pastor of First Methodist Church in Pascagoula.  She's buried at Machpelah Cemetery.
