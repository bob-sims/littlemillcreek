Elias was born in New York July 4, 1814.  His mother was Ann (?) _______ Campbell.  Family legend describes her as a widow with four children (three sons: Grant, A. P. and Elias and one daughter) who settled in South Carolina.

Elias became a carriagemaker.

On Feb 9, 1842 in Marlboro County, SC he married Annice (or Annis) Pearson, (b. Oct 7, 1816) daughter of William Henry Pearson and Sarah Pledger Steed Pearson.  When Annice was a toddler, her father died, and her mother married Daniel Britton.  Sarah owned slaves.

Family legend reports that Elias was strongly opposed to slavery.  However, his wife Annice kept slaves given to her by her mother.
 
At times craftsmen had a hard time collecting payment for their work.  Elias was probably never paid for part of his work, and consequently he was unable to pay his bills.  Between Fall 1845 and March 1850 his name appeared 21 times in Court of Common Pleas cases in Marlboro Co. because he was unable to pay his debts.  (The court met twice a year in Fall and in Spring.)  Although the amounts were modest such as $41.16 or $24.49 on each occasion interest and court expenses were added.  

In 1850 the census (taken Sept 12, 1850) records Elias and Annice and their young family living with Annice's mother, Sarah Britton, on her farm.  Elias is listed as the head of the household.

Late in 1851 Elias sold slaves to pay off accumulated debts.  One family of slaves (a man Jacob, his wife Sary and their three children John 10, Anna 7 and Henny 3) were sold to Zachariah Drake.  Zachariah paid Elias $10 and M. Townsend, the principal creditor, $1073.73.

December 1, 1851, Sarah and her son William G. Steed Jr. sold the farm.

The family moved to Alabama in December 1851 or early 1852.  They moved in ox-drawn wagons with other families.  Each night they camped along the way.  Their oldest child, Elizabeth remembered the boys and baying hounds chasing rabbits near their camps at night.  Black and white boys hunted together.

Family legend suggests that they settled in Wilcox Co., AL.  

Later they lived in Choctaw Co. in SW AL.   Their home was between Barrytown and Womack Hill.  (Unfortunately, no census records exist for the family in AL.)

Elias built a boat landing on the Tombigbee River in Choctaw Co.  After years of operation that site became known as Campbell's landing or Campbells.  In 1856 the Mobile City Directory began to list boat landings along the Alabama, Tombigbee and Warrior Rivers.  Campbell's appeared in the list of landings along the Tombigbee from 1856 to 1900 and possibly thereafter.  It was described as 168.5 miles upstream between Cade Bend and John Picken's.  It is absent from 1996 county maps.

Sadly, Elias died Dec 4, 1868.  He was buried in the Hamrick Field cemetery south of the road from Barrytown to Souwilpa Creek.
