Inez was born August 21, 1916 the youngest child of William Randall and Dora Havens.  She was born at the family home on Old Kelley Rd. north of Vancleave, MS.

Bill and Dora operated a large farm.  With 9 older brothers and sisters and one younger foster brother, Clinton Cates, the farm was lively.

As a childhood game the children would bat bumblebees with short planks!  Inez recalled dyeing eggs for Easter using yellow wildflowers.

Inez was about 7 when she began school.

She and Elsie, her youngest sister, would ride horses in the woods late every afternoon to collect the cows and bring them home.   They gathered about 100 cows each evening.  One day while on horseback in the woods lightening struck a tree nearby.  It threw her off the horse, but did not injure her.  This made her wary of lightening as an adult.

In September 1928, she was promoted from the Junior Department of the Methodist Sunday School to the Intermediate Department.  The frayed certificate that she received is decorated with a spray of pink single roses and a picture of Jesus.  Mrs. Cora Kelley, Jennivee's mother-in-law signed the certificate as head of the Junior Department.

On March 17, 1929, when she was 12, Inez wrote a letter to her brother Ira.  Written on a blue folded sheet, the letter, complete with her spelling, reads:

"Vancleave, Miss

(She drew a picture of herself at the bottom.)

Inez attended school in Vancleave.  They drove themselves to school in a horse and buggy with the roof removed.  Sometimes for fun on the way home from school in crossing the branch, Inez would drive the buggy through the water instead of going over the bridge.

In 1932 she attended the hexagonal school east of the intersection of highway 57 and old River Road.  Her Dad used ox teams to haul lumber for its construction.  It was built on tall blocks to protect it from flooding.

She played basketball on the girl's team.  At that time women's basketball was played on only half of the court.  The team played Wade, Moss Point and Daisy Vestry.

In April 1938 Inez graduated from Vancleave high school from this building.  That same evening she married Victor Sims, son of Waldo and Idell Sims.  The Reverend Rob Vaughn performed the ceremony at his home.  Inez wore a dark dress made of soft fabric with tiny buttons with rhinestones in them.

The couple lived in a home that Victor built on Sims Mill Pond Rd. off Old River Rd. north of Vancleave.  Victor's parents lived just north of them.  Victor farmed, operated a water-powered grist mill and kept bees.

Inez was stung by a honeybee on her chest above her heart.  She had a severe reaction.   Large welts formed on her skin; her ears thickened; her tongue swelled and she was dangerously sick.  Dr.   Charles Watkins gave her an injection of adrenalin.  She recovered and always carried small bottles of camphor and ammonia in her purse.  The doctor had recommended these as treatment should she be stung again.  Victor sold the honeybees.

The Sims family had known Dr. Watkins when they lived in Jones County before they moved to the coast in l932.  Discovering that Vancleave had no physician, Bruce Sims, Victor's brother, wrote to Dr. Watkins inviting him to move to the community.  His office was in the building with Dees General Store.

From a bad head cold, Inez developed mastoiditis.  The bone behind the ear lobe became infected.  Victor carried her to Dr. Werlein in Biloxi, an ear, eye, nose and throat specialist, for treatment.  Dr. Werlein operated, assisted by Dr. Watkins, removed some bone and drained the pus.  After healing, a depression remained behind that ear.  Later the introduction of antibiotics and penicillin prevented the need for this surgery.

Victor and Inez had two children.  Florence Elizabeth was born May 28, 1940.  Assisted by Dr. Watkins after prolonged labor Elizabeth was born at home.  The baby under the influence of sedatives given to Inez was given several drops of coffee in a spoon to awaken it.  Because of her difficulty, Dr. Watkins recommended that she not have any more children.  When Waldo came to visit Victor, Inez and the baby, he brought a big, fine sweet potato as a gift.   

Victor Hugo was born June 23, 1943.  Hugo was born in the hospital in Pascagoula.  Dr. Ely from Moss Point helped with an easy delivery.  Unfortunately, Dr. Ely was injured in a car accident the next day, and Dr. James Thompson continued Inez's care.

In about 1944 Inez rode the bus to Jackson, MS where she received a treatment to prevent pregnancy.  Dr. Applewhite irradiated her ovaries with x-rays.  This produced sterility and probably contributed to the ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer that she later suffered.

From 1947 until December 1948 the family lived with Bill and Dora Havens at the Havens family home in Vancleave.  This enabled Inez to care for her aging parents.  Bill Havens was bedridden most of the time with asthma.  Inez cooked, washed and cleaned.   She carried the dirty laundry to Mrs Taylor's, a Black neighbor.  Living closer to town she had electricity and a Maytag ringer washing machine.  Because she had no hot water heater, Inez heated water in a black washpot over a fire outside for her washing. 

Victor had a new well drilled and put in a new water pump.  He also wired the house for electrical service.  For the power company to install a power line a certain number of homes had to become customers.  Victor wired several other houses (without pay) to obtain service for that area.

As she aged Dora became difficult to get along with.  She complained that Inez was wearing out sheets by washing them too much!  Her behavior finally forced Victor and Inez in December 1948, to move their family to their home on Williams St. in Pascagoula.  Inez lived here for the remainder of her life.

A two room house was moved onto the pine covered lots in 1943.  To that a front porch and back porch with bath were first added.  Later three bedrooms were built on the south side and the front porch was enclosed to enlarge the living room.  All the carpentry, plumbing and wiring were done by Victor with help from Bruce and their uncles Jack and Alonzo Nixon.

The family kept a jersey milk cow.  She was staked out to graze during the day and kept in a stall at night.  Inez raised laying hens.  White leghorns supplied fresh eggs.  The vegetable garden contributed its riches.  Victor pushed a hand plow to till the garden.  For several years luscious strawberries flourished.
Excess strawberries were frozen in quart milk boxes in the deep freezer.

Inez enjoyed quilting.  Often when she sat down to rest she would cut out quilt pieces from cotton fabric scraps.  Others teased her that some of her scraps were too small.  She would sew several scraps together to form one piece.  She pieced her pieces!  She used several patterns; Many of her quilts were log cabin design.  She stitched the pieces on a peddle Singer sewing machine that Victor had electrified.  Quilting frames were hung on the front porch and either cotton or wool batts filled the quilts.


Around 1950 she listened to midday radio serials, the original soap operas.  She heard "Helen Trent" and "Ma Perkins" among others.  After supper in the evenings the family would listen to news on the radio.  John W. Van der Cook reported the news.  Then weekly radio dramas followed: "Mr. Keene, tracer of lost persons", "Johnny Dollar", and radio comedies: "Our Miss Brooks" and "Amos n' Andy".

Inez became a Cub Scout den mother.  She was active in PTA first in Beach Elementary School and then junior high and high school.  She helped with the first Mother's March of Dimes, organized by the PTA.  She joined Eastern Star and the Rebekahs (the women's part of the Oddfellow's lodge).  Her first and strongest commitment was to her family.

She first felt masses in her abdomen about 1953.  The doctor told her not to worry, they were harmless.  In about 1954 large malignant cysts were removed from her ovaries.  She received radium treatments, x-ray treatments, soaked in water as hot as she could stand and throughout maintained a good sense of humor.  She joked that St Peter would have to knock her in the head on judgement day!

Inez died Sunday June 21, 1959, the first patient to die in the new Singing River Hospital on highway 90 in Pascagoula.  Victor and Annie Walker, her sister, were with her when she died.  The funeral service was Monday June 22 from Fails Funeral Home with burial at Machpelah cemetery.  Rev. Arthur Schneider assisted with the services.
