Mary Jane was born Nov 23, 1853, the twelth of 13 children of James Roberts (b. 29 Mar 1806; d. 18 Feb 1883) and Mary Ann "Polly" Goff Roberts (b. 17 Jan 1812; d. 22 Jan 1880).  Her parents married 21 Feb 1830.

In the 1860 federal agricultural census of Jackson Co. her parents owned 40 improved acres and 380 unimproved acres.  Their land was valued at $300.  Their livestock included 40 milk cows, 4 oxen, 70 other cattle, 100 sheep, and 80 hogs.  The total livestock value was estimated at $120.  During the previous year the farm produced 210 lbs. of wool and 200 lbs. of honey.  Mary Jane grew up in a prosperous family.

On December 31, 1868, she married Jefferson Hill Havens (b. July 28, 1846), son of Jack and Sabra Fletcher Havens.  Mary Jane's maternal grandfather, Lewis Goff, was the brother of Elizabeth Goff, Jeff's maternal grandmother, making Mary Jane and Jeff second cousins.

Mary Jane had gravestones placed at her parents graves at the old Bill McMillan-Mt. Pleasant Cemetery (on Lockard property).  They were made of poured concrete inscribed with hand lettering.

School teachers boarded in their home.  One taught Mary Jane to sew.

From homespun wool thread she knitted socks.  She traded a peddlar socks for a pretty clear glass pitcher.  It's decorated with a band of medallions around the constricted center.  They used it for lemonade in Summer.  Today her granddaughter Jennivee cherishes that pitcher.

Mary Jane died at their home June 2, 1936.  Her obituary in the local newspaper, the Chronicle Star praised her.  It said, in part,

"Many hearts were saddened in Jackson County last Tuesday, when it became known that Mrs. Jeff Havens, of Vancleave, had passed to the beyond, her death occurring at 2:30 a. m. June 2, at the late home.  She had lived her entire life in the county of her birth, and it had been a full and active life, a happy life and one filled with good deeds.  It is said that the home life of "Uncle Jeff and Aunt Mary" was well-nigh perfect, so sweetly and harmoniously did they go about the serious job we call living.  The call for help and advice never went unheeded by this good woman, and the lives of her community, her friends and her church were made richer by her contact with them.  She was a devout member of the Methodist Church and active in its affairs.  A large number...mourn the passing of this grand old mother and citizen." 

Rev. H. W. Van Hook, Methodist minister, conducted the funeral service assisted by the Rev. Rob L. Vaughn.  She is buried at the Havens cemetery north of their home.
