Ruby was born in 1875 the fourth child and third daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Campbell Sims.  She was born at what later became the Cooper Whigham farm in Womack Hill in Choctaw Co. in SW Alabama.

She was named for a large, handsome magnolia tree in the backyard.

About 1900 her brother Waldo sold their father's property in Choctaw Co., AL.  The money from this sale was divided among the children and their mother.

That same year her older sister Laura Horton named her second daughter after Ruby.

Ruby had a horse and black buggy that she drove on errands.  The buggy had one seat (for two riders) and no top.  She never learned to drive an automobile.

About 1910 health problems forced her to have abdominal surgery.
Dr. Donald was her surgeon.

Ruby was an avid reader.  They subscribed to the "Pathfinder" a weekly news magazine from Washington, DC.  It provided good coverage of foreign events.

Max Norwood, her nephew, lived with Ruby and her mother for several years.  Ruby educated him and, to a lesser extent, his twin brother Joe.  She helped her nephews and nieces compose letters.

She enjoyed walking to the neighbors and friend's homes to visit.  In about 1915, her nephew Victor went with her to Mr. Polly Baylis's.  His daughter-in-law was a pretty young Slavonian woman.  Conversation enriched their lives. 

That same year Victor recalls walking with his Aunt Ruby from Moselle where his family lived to Estabutchie where she lived.  It was nearly 5 miles, and they had stopped to rest when a family in a wagon stopped and offered them a ride.  Ruby kindly thanked them but said they would walk.  After the family had passed young Victor asked, "Why didn't we ride with those folks?"  Ruby responded, "Honey, you didn't look at those pore horses.  They only feed those horses grass.  They have to stop now and then to let the horses rest.  We don't want to burden those horses any more."
 
On one visit she brought Victor a poem.  He memorized it and recited it in school.  It was entitled "The Farmer's Lament".

Why did you leave the farm, my lad?
Why did you bolt and leave your dad?
Why did you beat it off to town, 
And turn your poor old father down?
Thinkers of platform, pulpit and press
Are wallowing in deep distress.
They seek to know the hidden cause,
Why farmer boys desert their paws!
Well, stranger, since you've been so frank,
I'll roll aside that hazy bank.
I left my Dad, 'twas wrong of course,
Because my colt became his horse.
I left my Dad his farm to plow,
Because my calf became his cow.
I left my Dad to sow and reap,
Because my lamb, became his sheep.
I dropped the hoe and stuck the fork,
Because my pig became his pork.
The garden truck that I made grow, 
Was his to sell, but mine to hoe.
It's not the smoke in the atmosphere,
Or the taste of life, that brought me here.
Please tell the platform, pulpit and press
No fear of toil, nor love of dress,
Is driving off the farm boy lads.
It's just the methods of their Dads!

Victor still remembered and recited this poem in 1995.

Solie grew cotton several years.  Ruby picked most of it.

In about 1920 Ruby bought rental property on Hardy St. in Hattiesburg.  For several years she rented this house unfurnished.  She had a good business sense and was careful with her money.  
She contributed money periodically to help support her sister Cookie Norwood and her family.  She did not lose any money in the financial crash of 1929.

About 1925 she married        McInnis.  Although he was a good carpenter, he was an alcoholic.  He built a neat wooden bathtub for their house in Hattiesburg.  Made from a 1 x 20" plank it had flared sides.  Cloth strips placed between the boards as it was being built sealed the joints.  Painted white, it drained through a pipe in the floor.

Not long after their divorce, he was struck and killed by a train.

Waldo complimented his sister by saying, "Don't sell Ruby short, she's the smartest member of the family."

In November 1929, her mother Elizabeth at age 86 had a debilitating stroke.  After several days, she died.  Ruby was left with Solie who would not assume responsibilities.  She moved to Hattiesburg.

From loneliness in about 1930 she married Wyatt Jordan.  Unfortunately, he also drank too much.  She never had any children.

Often Wyatt lounged around the place sharpening a large bowie knife.  As Solie returned home once,  he walked toward him making threatening gestures with his knife.  Solie picked up a piece of iron from the ground and threw it at him striking him on the forehead.  It knocked him out.  After his recovery he was more docile and respectful.

Ruby divorced Wyatt Jordan.

In 1931 she lived in Hattiesburg.  She returned to Estabutchie in 1932 to live in her mother's house.

About 1932 she bought a house and lot in Estabutchie.  With a front porch it included 3 large rooms and a rear kitchen.  The west room had a fireplace; the kitchen, which was down two steps, had a woodstove.  The 12-14' well in the backyard had a pump for drawing water.

Ruby tended a vegetable garden.  She maintained a flock of about 2 dozen chickens.  She sold extra eggs in town.  

Solie bought a jersey heifer, "Trennie", the first jersey in the community.  Her milk was richer than other breeds.  They kept 10 to 12 cows.  Occasionally Ruby sold butter.

Victor remembers enjoying her fried chicken, her chicken pies and especially her cobbler pies.  She canned half gallons of peaches and other fruits without sugar.  They ate blackberry, huckleberry and peach pies.

Ruby visited her sister Cookie Norwood in Gulfport in about 1933.  She was interested in buying some beach property there.  She was not able to persuade others in the family to contribute money for this project.

The family had a large photograph album.  It had cream colored pages and a tortoise-shell cover.

She mailed birthday cards to relatives regularly.  She signed them, "Aunt Ruby" followed by a string of X's for kisses.

She was generally healthy throughout most of her life.  A dentist had repaired teeth with gold fillings.  She never broke any bones.  However as she aged, she showed signs of osteoporosis.

In a letter written to her sister Laura in June 1951, she explained that she is not well.  She expresses delight that Laura and her son Cecil are coming for a visit.  She says, "I'm sending Solie to prop up the bean poles.  The wind has laid them every one flat on the ground and we are so hopeful to have them grown big enough by the time you arrive."

Sadly, on June 14, 1959, Ruby died.  The Rev. Hardy Norsworthy, a former friend of the family from Waynesboro, conducted her funeral service.  She is buried in Estabutchie in the plot with her mother and her brothers, Solie and Iggie.
