Born in Frederick Co., VA near Winchester in the northern tip of the state,  John was the son of John and Sarah Havens II.  He was born July 4, 1775.

Between 1787 and 1798 the family migrated to the Mobile area in south AL.

A document (in American State Papers) from 1834 lists John Haven as the original settler in 1802 of land settled in 1809 by Pierre Lardnier (sic).  Described as in LA in the district east of the Pearl River, this claim was situated on the Pascagoula River.  In 1811 William Flurry lived with John Haven, but cultivated land on Black Creek.

About 1811 he married Susan Flurry.  Susan was the daughter of William (?) Flurry.

Susan and John's children included (in this approximate order):

1) John "Jack" Havens (b. July 24, 1812; d. Jan 19, 1900) (md. Sabra Fletcher).
 	2) Massie Havens (md. Jason Smith (b. 1802); had 7 children).
3) Ann Havens (b. 1816; d. 1898; md. Edward Jean Baptiste David, a frenchman.)
4) Sarah Havens (b. 26 Feb 1821; d. 3 June 1860; md. Wm. H. Fletcher).
5) William Havens
6) Henry Havens
7) Joseph Havens
8) Charles Havens (b. 15 Feb 1826; d. 1 Aug 1903; md. Louise Roberts (b. 29 July 1835; d. in yellow fever epidemic of 1878). 

John and Susan are named in Creole Mobile, a listing of families on the gulf coast between 1702 and 1813.

In 1817 he was listed in Jackson Co. personal tax rolls.  For 1 poll he paid $.62 1/2 territorial tax and $.31 1/4 county tax!

The Jackson County tax rolls for 1819 specify that John's family included 1 white poll.  He paid $1 in state taxes and $.50 in county taxes that year.

For 1820, the next year, he paid $.75 in county taxes.

The 1820 federal census listed John and Susan with 3 boys under 10 and 2 girls under 10.  Both John and Susan were 26 to 45 years old.

In 1821 he patented 607.3 acres of land on the west bank of the Pascagoula River.  It lay in section 11, township 5, range 7 west.  A map appears below.
 
In 1825 the MS state census recorded 4 males, 4 females and 1 taxable person in the family.  There had been 1 birth and 1 death within the year.

Tragically, about 1826 Susan died.  She may have never recovered from the birth that year of her youngest child, Charles.


The 1830 federal census recorded 1 son under 10, 1 10-20, 1 daughter under 10, and 1 10-20.  John was then 40-60 years old.

The 1840 federal census listed John as 60-70 with one son 10-15 and two daughters 15-20.

For 1850 in that same census John was given as 73 years old.  Two of his daughters remained at home caring for him: Anna Baptiste, a widow (?), 34, with her two young children Edward Baptiste, 6, and Mary Baptiste, 4, and Sarah Havens, 8.  All except John were born in Mississippi.
 
The federal agricultural census for 1850 listed John with 2 horses, 20 milk cows, 40 other cattle and 12 hogs.  His livestock was valued at $640. 

Sadly, John died in 1855.  He's buried at the Fletcher Cemetery east of Old River Road about 8 miles north of Vancleave.  A granite tombstone marks his grave.
