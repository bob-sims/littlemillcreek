Jackson, the son of Reddick (b. 1793) and Mary Clarke Smith (b. 1805), was born in SE Alabama February 9, 1827.

On January 28, 1847, he married Sarah Nixon.  Z. J. Daniel, the Justice of the Peace for Barbour Co., AL performed the ceremony.

About 1851 the family moved to Jasper Co., MS.  While the children born in 1848 and 1850 were born in Alabama, the child born in 1852 and all thereafter were born in Jasper County.  Reddick and Mary moved as well.

Jackson appears in Jasper Co. poll tax records for 1853 and 1856.  White males aged 21 to 50 paid poll taxes.  In both years he paid for one poll in 1853 $.31 1/4 and in 1856 $.40.

In 1859 he obtained three land grants in township 3 range 11: one in section 5 and two in section 9.

The 1860 census recorded on 15 September 1860 lists him as a farmer and gives the value of his real estate at $600 and the value of his personal estate at $300.  He and Sarah have 7 children.  The oldest is 12; the youngest is 5 months.

According to the 1860 federal agricultural census his farm consisted of 40 improved acres and 80 unimproved ones.  It was valued at $600.  His livestock included l horse, l milk cow, 2 oxen, 3 other cattle, and 23 hogs.  All the stock was valued at $200.  That slaughtered during the previous year was worth $80.  During the previous year he produced 150 bushels of corn, 20 bushels of peas and beans, 50 bushels of sweet potatoes, 3 400# bales of ginned cotton and l ton of hay.

He volunteered for service in the 3rd Mississippi Regiment during the Civil war.  Mustered into service at Camp Moore at Marion, MS, he was a private in Capt. W. H. Morgan's Company, the Sunflower Dispersers.   In July 1863, he is listed as a sargent in the (new) Company B.  However on July 31, 1863 he is reported as absent without leave.  He might have gone home to help his family.  There is a story that he and a neighbor returned home at night and to surprise their families, working together they plowed their gardens.  As punishment for his absence, effective on October 1, 1863, he was reduced in rank to private.  He was wounded during the war.

H. Grady Howell has written a 644 page book, entitled, To Live and Die in Dixie, that presents a history of the 3rd Mississippi Regiment in the Civil War.  Jackson's name appears in his unit.

Because there were two men named Andrew Jackson Smith in this same regiment, the record is unfortunately confused.  In the National Archives records of the two men are combined as one.  The second A. J. Smith enlisted 27 Sept 1861 at Shieldsboro, near Bay St. Louis in Hancock County.  He died in 1914 in Shieldsboro and is listed among Mississippi Masonic Death Records 1819-1919.
  
Mississippi conducted a state census in 1866.  Jackson and Sarah's household (on page 24) includes 2 sons 10-20 years old; Jackson 30-40; 2 daughters less than 10; 2 10 to 20 and Sarah 30-40.

Jackson became a Baptist minister.  He helped organize the Palestine Baptist Church near Montrose, MS.  Either he or his father gave the land on which the present church stands.  Jackson served as the pastor there for a number of years.

The 1870 federal census recorded on 16 June 1870 lists him as a farmer and gives the value of his real estate at $480 and the value of his personal estate at $115.  The Civil War has reduced his holdings.  Nine children and one grandchild, Wilma (?) Walley, (Sarah Lucinda Smith Walley's daughter,) live at home.  The oldest is 20, the youngest is one.

The agricultural census for that same year described his farm as 40 improved acres and 120 acres of unimproved land (primarily woodland).  The following values were assigned: total farm, $500; value of impliments, $100; livestock, $415; animals slaughtered, $40; all farm production, $325.  His livestock included: 1 horse, 1 mule or ass, 3 milk cows, 1 other cow and 7 hogs.  The farm produced 100 bushels of corn, 1 450# bale of cotton, 25 bushels of sweet potatoes and 100 lbs. of butter.

Again in 1880 the agricultural census recorded him tilling 70 acres with 170 acres of woodland.  His farm was valued at $240.  His impliments had a value of $40; his livestock, $240; his farm production, $680.  His livestock included 4 horses, 2 oxen, 7 milk cows, 2 other cattle, 4 calves, 20 hogs, and 20 chickens.  During the previous year he spent $25 on fences and the farm produced 150 lbs of butter, 50 dozen eggs and 7 bushels of cowpeas.  From 25 acres he harvested 250 bushels of corn.  From 1 acre he harvested 800 lbs. of rice.  From 5 acres he harvested 40 bushels of oats.  On 27 acres he made 7 bales of cotton.  From 1 acre he dug 20 bushels of sweet potatoes.
 
Land accessment tax records are available for Jasper Co. for 1889.  Although they are illegible, in part, from the entries that are clear, we know that Jackson had at least 108 acres of cleared land and 272 acres uncleared.  For it he paid $17.28 tax that year.

Personal tax records are available for 1894.  Jackson owned 2 horses valued at $150; 5 hogs valued at $3; one carriage valued at $35; one watch valued at $5.  He also owned 4 cows and 10 hogs classed as exempt property.  For these he paid taxes of $2.36 8/10.

Personal tax records from 1895 show that he owned the following: 6 cows valued at $30; 2 horses valued at $100; 8 hogs valued at $8; 2 carriages valued at $40; one watch valued at $5.  Again 4 cows and 10 hogs are exempt.  His taxes were $1.13 1/2.

Personal tax records from 1898 list the following: one horse valued at $40; 2 carriages valued at $35; 1 watch valued at $3; and l pistol, bowie knife or sword cane valued at $5.  His taxes equaled $.70 2/10.

On March 11, 1900 Jackson died.  According to family legend he had gastric ulcers and Bright's disease (kidney disease).  According to information on the application for his confederate tombstone (provided by Mrs. Frank Walley), he died of "old wounds".  He's buried at Palestine Church Cemetery.  The confederate veteran's stone reads, "Andrew J. Smith Co B 3 Miss Inf CSA."
