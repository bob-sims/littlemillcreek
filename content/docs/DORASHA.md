Dora was born January 21, 1874 the daughter of Calvin and Elizabeth Mulholland Seymour.

She attended school first in Latimer.  Then she went to a Catholic school on Howard Ave. in Biloxi through the eighth grade.  She stayed with Aunt Celina and Uncle Jeff Mulholland there.

On September 3, 1894 she married William Randall Havens.  The ceremony was performed by Judge Ellis Overstreet of Moss Point.

As a young adult she had black hair and dark brown eyes.  She weighed about 135 lbs. 

When newly married she cooked a whole package of dried red beans.  They ate beans for several meals and still there were beans.  She got rid of her mistake by burying them in the backyard!

She became a good cook.  Elsie said she was the best meat cook around.

Dora and Bill had the following children: 

1) Ester Maye Havens (b. July 24, 1895)(md. Vincent Torres) 
2) William Adolf Havens (b. Feb. 4, 1897; d. Mar 2, 1915 of pneumonia) 
3) Calvin Jefferson Havens (b. Dec. 9, 1898)(md. Sarah Echoles). 
4) Mary Elizabeth Havens (b. Nov. 5, 1900) 
5) Ira Thurman Havens (b. Jan. 5, 1903; d. Apr 4, 1959)(md. Margaret Ellis (b. Dec 22, 1904; d. June 12, 1984)). 
6) Annie Christina Havens (b. Nov. 10, 1905)(md. Norman Walker) 	
7) Lucille Havens (b. Jan 18, 1908)(md. Johnny Flurry) 
8) Yeul Harmon Havens (b. May 28, 1911)(md. Irma Daffin) 	
9) Elsie Irean Havens (b. Oct. 5, 1913)(md. Roscoe Fletcher) 
10) Inez Havens (b. Aug. 21, 1916; d. June 21, 1959)(md. Victor H. Sims).

The first nine children were delivered by a midwife, Aunt Kit Ely Mayfield.  Because Dora was older, her last child, Inez, was delivered by a physician, possibly Dr. Kennedy.

William Adolf was named for his dad and his uncle Adolf Hunt, Aunt Nora Seymour Hunt's husband.  Calvin Jefferson was named for his two grandfathers.  Mary Elizabeth was named for her grandmother Elizabeth Mulholland Seymour.  Harmon was named for Capt. Yuel who served in the Civil War with his grandfather and Harmon Wilson, a fine man and a farmer.  Elsie Irean was named for Irean Moore McKay.

Tragically, Mary Elizabeth died of colitis at age two on July 25, 1902; Dolf died of pneumonia contracted after plowing in a drizzling rain at age 18 on March 2, 1915.
 
Dora made all her children's clothes.  She sewed on a Singer peddle sewing machine. 

She taught Elsie how to crochet.  However she didn't crochet very much.  She preferred to piece quilts.  After the girls cut out quilt pieces from cotton scraps , she would stitch them on the machine.  When a quilt top was finished, they would quilt it.

The family used wool from their sheep as filling for the quilts.  After washing the new wool was carded.  Carding removed the trash and fluffed the wool up.  Newly carded wool was carefully arranged on newspaper spread on the floor.  A second newspaper separated the second layer of carded wool.  Each newspaper was lifted to transfer the wool to the quilt lining.  The linings were made from dark plaid outing (flannel) or sugar sack material.

The quilting frames were put together with screws and placed on the backs of four chairs on the back porch.  Dora quilted most of their quilts stitching in a fan pattern.  Elsie remembers her mother teaching them by holding a string at one end and moving the other end through an arc to help them learn the pattern.  Elsie was about 12 when she learned to quilt.  Over the years Dora made about 100 quilts!

The family bought a box canner in Biloxi for use over a fire outside. They canned beef, tomatoes and corn in metal cans.  After the lid was soldered on the can, it was cooked in a water bath.  If the can bubbled, it needed to be resoldered.  They canned peaches, pears and berries in glass jars.

For Christmas they would have a special meal.  Bill usually shot a wild turkey.  Dora would make ambrosia (fruit salad) and a special pudding.  Made from flour, a little sugar, raisens and nutmeg, it was boiled for 3 hours in a thin flour sack.  It was served with a white sauce.

She would discipline Elsie and Inez by sending one to the smoke house and the other to the storm house.  If children misbehaved at a meal, that child was sent into the kitchen to eat on the flour barrel.

Once when Harmon was teasing Lucille, she tried to kick him.  He caught her foot causing her to fall and sprain her ankle.  Dora wrapped the ankle in a mixture of clay and vinegar.  It hardened forming a cast.  After several days when the clay was removed, the swelling was gone.  Other families used this same remedy.

When the men and boys brought game animals home that they did not eat, Dora would cook it for the dogs.

In 1936 Clinton Cates came at age 14 to live with the family as a foster child.  He remained there 5 years.  He praises the entire family as fine folks.

In 1941 while feeding sugar cane into the mill, it caught her right hand and mangled it.  Bill saw the accident and immediately stopped the horse and mill.  Dora walked to the house 100 yards away.  One finger was attached only by a piece of skin.  She placed her hand on a cutting board and using a butcher knife severed that finger.  Her hand bled and then oozed blood through the night.  Old Red Burney carried her in his arms to Madeline Bilbo's car. (Madeline used it for hauling moonshine!)  Madeline drove her to the old Jackson County hospital in Pascagoula.  Dr. Lockard sewed up her wound.  Through this ordeal she proved her strength and fortitude.

She lost one complete finger and half another from her right hand.  Thereafter she continued to write with that hand.

On April 4, 1959 her son, Ira was shot and killed in a hunting accident.  He was turkey hunting and was found with the turkey call in his mouth.  He is buried at the Vancleave Cemetery.

On June 21 of that same year her daughter Inez Sims died of ovarian cancer.  She is buried at Machpelah cemetery in Pascagoula.

Dora died August 16, 1965 in Winona at Lucille's home.  She is buried in the Havens cemetery in Vancleave beside Bill.
