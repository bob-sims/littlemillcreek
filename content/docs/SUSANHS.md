Susan was born May 15, 1812, in North Carolina.  She had a twin sister, Sophia.  Her dad, whose name is unknown, was born in North Carolina.  In 1820 when the twins would have been 8, in Bladen Co., NC (a possible birthplace) only Stephen Hester and Thomas Hester, Jr had 2 girls under 10 in their households.  In 1830 when they would have been 18, only Thomas Hester, Sr. (aged 70 to 80) and his wife Rebecca Hester had 2 girls 15 to 20 in their household.  They were possibly the twins grandparents.  

Her mother, whose name is unknown, was born in France.  From her mother's influence she spoke with a slight French accent throughout her life.

Family legend suggests that her twin sister married a Mr. Foster (or Forrester) and moved to Texas.

Susan married William Sims (b. 1805), son of Sarah Sims, about 1834.

Susan and Wiley had the following children:

1) Sarah Sims (b. 1835; md. William McMichael).
2) Harriet Amanda "Mandy" Sims (b. 1837; md. 1) James Slaughter, 2) Tom Moseley).
3) Robert E. Sims (b. 1839; md. Elizabeth Campbell).
4) John L. Sims (b. 1845; md. Christian Oates).
5) William Knealon "Neal" Sims (b. 1848; md. 1) 18 May 1874 Sarah Christian McGregor, 2) 7 Nov 1877 Mary C. Nordan).
6) James W. Sims (b. 1849; 5 Apr 1882 md. Nancy E. Bozone (daughter of Wm. M. Bozone (d. July 1, 1893) & Francis Bozone)).

In late 1844 or early 1845, the family moved to Choctaw Co. in SW Alabama.

The 1850 federal census recorded the family living next door to Benjamin and Narcissa Sims, William's uncle and aunt.

Susan served as a midwife, helping family members with childbirth.

Sadly, in about 1852 William died.

Susan married Lamuel (or Lemuel) McMichael (b. 1793 or 1797 in GA), a widower, with children of his own in about 1853.

Lamuel's and his previous wife's known children were:

1) William McMichael (b. 1830? in GA; d. Oct 28, 1894; md. 1) Sarah Sims; had at least 3 children; 2) in 1890, Mrs. Sarah A. Maiden).
2) Isabella McMichael (b. 1830?, possibly a twin of William; an idiot).
3) Susan McMichael (b. 1843).
4 & 5) twins: Zachariah and Samuel David McMichael, (b. Aug 1849).  On Feb 21, 1878, Zachariah married Amelia P. Averyt (daughter of Martha E. Averyt).  They had a daughter Amelia (b. Oct 1880).  Unfortunately Zachariah's wife died before 1900, when he is listed as a widower.  David married Ellen _______ (b. 1852 in AL).  They had Frances (b. 1867) and James (b. Apr. 1870).

The book Trailing Our Ancestors by the late Lois McMichael presents the lineage of a family of McMichaels, originally from Pennsylvania, that settled in 1787 and lived for several generations in Georgia.  Lamuel is not named in this book.  However, because the names William, Zachariah and David occur in this GA family and because they have more than one set of twins, I believe that Lamuel is a part of that McMichael family.

On Dec 8, 1854 Lamuel and Susan had a daughter Caroline, their only child.

On Aug 5, 1859 they sold 100 acres of land to William McLean for $320.  It was farm land situated in Choctaw Co. in section 13, township 10 (or 11), range 3 west.  The deed was not recorded at the courthouse until July 5, 1872, (or perhaps it was re-recorded after the courthouse fire.)
 
The Sims family thought highly of Lamuel.  According to Victor Sims, he was a fine man.

Sadly, Lamuel died about 1875.

Tragically, Susan died Feb. 28, 1880, of pneumonia.  Dr. Harrell had attended her.
