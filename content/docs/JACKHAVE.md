Born July 24, 1812, Jack was the oldest son of John Havens III and Susan Flurry Havens. 

Tragically, his mother died in 1826 when he was only 14.

On Oct. 3, 1830, he married Sabra Fletcher (b. 1812 in GA), daughter of Henry and Elizabeth Goff Fletcher.

Their children were:

1. Henry C. Havens (b. Oct. 15, 1831; d. Feb 7, 1912; md. 1) Josephine Bowen (b. June 10, 1830); had 11 children; md. 2) Mrs. Rebecca Smith Davis (b. 1852); had 5 children; md. 3) Mary Franklin Cain (b. 1862); had 4 children; became a judge.)
2. Susanna Havens (b. Mar. 20, 1834; md. W. E. Retherford (b. 1830); had more than 2 children).
3. Louisiana Jane Havens (b. Jan. 2, 1836)
4. William L. Havens (b. Apr. 18, 1837; d. 1932; md. Mary Louise Ladnier; had 6 children).
5. Sarah Emeline Havens (b. Apr. 24, 1839; md. 1) Leonard Ladnier; had 3 children; md. 2) James Stephenson; had 2 children).

7. Asenath Havens (a girl) (b. Sept. 4, 1844; d. 1881; md. Henry Bond (b. 1840; d. 1915); married and lived in Beauregard Parish, LA; had 6 children).
8. Jefferson Hill Havens (b. July 28, 1846; md. Mary Jane Roberts; had 8 children).
9. Albert G. B. Havens (b. May 5, 1851; md. Mary Ellen Smith; had 8 children).
10. Charles E. Havens (b. May 28, 1853; md. Mary Ann Havens (b. Nov 8. 1850); had 3 children).
11. Sabra Ann "Lady" Havens (b. Feb. 28, 1856; md. James Reeves; had 4 children).
12. Virgil Robert "Bob" Havens (b. Feb. 10, 1858; became an M. D.; md. Frances Neely; had 7 children; lived in PA).

The 1850 federal census, enumerated 7 Sept 1850, listed Jack as a farmer, 38 years of age.  Sabra, given as 36, and the seven oldest children formed the household.  Henry (19), Susan (16), William (14) and Sarah Emeline (12) had attended school within that year.

The September 1850 federal agricultural census described his farm as 10 improved acres with a value of $150.  (The entry for unimproved land is unclear.)  His impliments had a value of $100; his livestock, a value of $1850; homemade goods, a value of $25; and animals slaughtered, $80.  His livestock included 8 horses, 60 milk cows, 4 oxen, 146 other cattle, 30 sheep and 200 hogs.  During the previous year his farm produced 200 bushels of corn, 100 lbs. of wool, 100 bushels of peas, 100 bushels of sweet potatoes and 20 lbs. of butter.

Over the years 1857 to 1892, 14 different tracts of land were purchased from the government by John Havenses.   It is often not clear which John Havens made the purchase.  Jack's son John, born in 1842, probably bought some of these tracts.  However most of the transactions were undoubtably by Jack.  On one occasion in 1862 he bought 560 acres in section 17, township 6 range 7 west.  

In 1860 the agricultural census described his farm as 15 improved and 440 unimproved acres with a value of $100.  His impliments were worth $10; his livestock $2500.  His stock included 3 horses, 40 milk cows, 120 other cattle, 175 sheep and 100 hogs.  His farm produced 350 lbs. of wool and 200 bushels of sweet potatoes. 

In the 1870 census taken July 14, 1870, Jack is listed as a farmer, 58.  His real estate has a value of $500; his personal estate has a value of $2000.  Sabra, aged 56, and Charles 17, Sabrie 14 and Robert 12, the three youngest children, complete the household.

Jack played the fiddle and drank.

He lived many years in Louisana, but we don't know when he moved there.  The 1880 federal census records him in the home of his son William L. and his wife, Mary L. Havens.  They lived in Beauregard Parish, at that time a part of Calcasieu Parish in SW LA.  Jack aged 68 is described as "at home" (under the heading for occupation.)  His sons, John F. and Albert G. B., and William L. and their families moved to LA in either 1875 or 1876 (based on where their children were born).  His son Charles moved his family to LA about 1879.  All lived in the same parish.

Sabra died August 4, 1882, and is buried at Lindsey Cemetery in the Dry Creek community in Beauregard Parish in western Louisiana.

One of his sons, Jeff's, friends from New Orleans brought the National Bank president from New Orleans to Jeff's farm in Jackson Co. to go deer hunting.  The bank president asked him, "Do you know John Havens?"  Jeff answered, "Yes, he is my dad."  The banker explained that John Havens had made the largest single deposit in the history of his bank!  He deposited money from the sale of land or sheep, wool and cows.

Jack moved to Pennsylvania to live with his son, a doctor, Virgil Robert "Bob" Havens.  Bob cheated his Dad out of his money and forced him to return to Jackson County, MS.

Their daughter Sarah Emeline, called Aunt Emeline, had married Leonard Ladnier.  Their son Albert Ladnier (with help from Jeff and Bill Havens) built a house for his granddad in his yard west of the New Prospect Campground.  He lived there until he died.  (After Leonard Ladnier died, Emeline married James Stevenson.)

Jack died Jan 19, 1900.  He is buried at the Fletcher Cemetery, east of Old River Road, north of Vancleave.  A granite headstone marks his grave.
