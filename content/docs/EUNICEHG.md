Eunice was born Dec. 15, 1878, the fourth of eight children of Rev. Jefferson Hill and Mary Jane Roberts Havens.  She was born at the Jim Kelley farm at the end of Old Kelley Rd. in Vancleave, MS.

She attended school about one mile north of their home.  Teachers boarded with their family.  Some helped her Dad by working in the field.  These taught regular daily lessons to the Havens children through the Summer.

Eunice took an exam at the courthouse in Scranton (later Pascagoula) given by an instructor from State Teachers College (USM).  By passing it, she obtained a state license to teach school.  Thereafter she taught school in several communities.

When grown she was about 5' 6" tall; she weighed about 135 lbs.  Her dark hair turned grey early.

On 19 Sept 1901 Eunice married Walter J. Green (b. Jan. 21, 1875 in Castleberry, Alabama).  Walter was the oldest son and second child in a family of 12 children of Jackson and Emma Brewton Green.  The ceremony was performed in her parents home. 

At first they lived at the R. V. Avent sawmill settlement in George Co.  Eunice ran the commissary at the sawmill.  She kept their books.  The commissary served as a general store.

Eunice and Walter had the following children: 

1) Walter Ohlen Green (b. Nov. 18, 1904; md. Mabel Ford). 
2) Reginald Jackson Green (b. Jan 11, 1911; md. Verlie Breland). 
3) Jennivee Green (b. Dec. 22, 1922; md. James W. Kelley (b. 1919?; d. Aug 12, 1994; son of John and Cora Kelley)).  Dr. McMillan delivered Jennivee at home.

For several years Eunice served as County Register for George Co.

The 1910 federal census lists Walter as a sawmill laborer.  Walter's brother Earnest Green (b. 1885), a railroad engineer, is living with them.

On Sept. 7, 1913 Eunice's sister Jenny Green died after childbirth.  She had married Ernest.  They had two babies: Henry Justin and Ernest Huntley (b. Aug 23, 1913; d. Oct 11, 1989; Aug 9, 1940 md. Neldra Fairley).  Their maiden sister Lily (Aunt Lil) raised Justin; Eunice and Walter raised Huntley.

(After Jenny's death Ernest married Ioda "Bill" Freeman and they had one son, Ernest Green Jr.  Ernest Sr. died about 1968 in Mobile, AL and is buried in Castleberry, AL.  Ernest Jr. retired from the marines and is now dead.)

(Later Justin married Lou Skeggs from Bowling Green, KY.  They lived on Peachtree St. in Atlanta, GA.  He worked as a salesman for National Cash Register and Burr Adding Machines, but wasted his money.  They had 3 children:  Dr. Tommy Green lives in Daytona, FL; Loretta Green Bryant works as a dental assistant; William (named for William R. Havens) Huntley Green, is called Billy Hunt.  Lou died of cancer on Thanksgiving Day in about 1962?.  Justin is also dead.)

About 1916 Walter and Eunice made their home at the old Reg Green house site.  This was near the old Bilbo landing and near the site of the first Jackson Co. Courthouse.  They bought 200 acres from Eunice's sister Melissa and her husband, John Allman.  They built a large farm.

They cared for livestock and sold calves and yearlings every year.  They also sold timber.  They raised sheep and for years they kept a shepard dog.

The 1920 census lists the family as Walter, 45; Eunice, 40; Ohlen, 15; Reginald, 9 and Ernest H. (Huntley), 7.

Eunice carefully decorated the interior of their home.  After painting the living room walls white she added pastel spots applied with a sponge.  For the opening between the living room and dining room she made a cane curtain.  Sections of reed cane and chinaberries were strung and hung from the top casing.  These tapered from short in the center of the doorway to almost floorlength at the sides.

Using oil paints she painted landscape pictures.  She also hooked rugs from wool scraps.  If she didn't have the correct color of wool, she would dye what she had.  She produced lovely rugs.

They had a dipping vat for livestock.  A concrete ditch, it was filled with dip from the state agriculture department.  The dip smelled like creosote and contained arsenic to kill lice and fever ticks.  Both the Greens' cows and those of other farmers such as John Wesley King, Elnora's Dad, were forced through this treatment.

Eunice made syrup every year.  She would make syrup for other farmers who didn't have a mill and a cooking pan from their cane.  Several years she made syrup for John King.

Tragically, on March 28, 1925, Walter died.  He had had surgery for gall stones.  After he came home he became sick with what was then called "ether pneumonia".  It killed him.  He is buried at the Pine Grove cemetery on highway 57 in Jackson County.

Another tragedy struck January 21, 1936, when Ohlen was killed on his dad's birthday.  He had married Mabel Ford, but they had no children.  He was operating a tractor-drawn road grader.   A second man drove the tractor.   After the blade beneath the machine struck an old stump, Ohlen was thrown and the blade struck the back of his head.  (Mabel later married Rev. Scott, a Methodist minister, but they had no children.)

At the time of her brother's death Jennivee age 13 was in the hospital in Mobile with a burst appendix.

In 1937 Eunice moved to the Jim Kelly farm after Aunt Lil died (on Sept. 10, 1937) to take care of her father.  (Aunt Lil had planted camellias at the Havens cemetery where she was later buried.)
Eunice lived there the remainder of her life.  

To take advantage of Aunt Lil's car, Eunice learned to drive.  She and Jennivee took their driving tests together at Ocean Springs in 1938.

In about 1943 she was hospitalized in Biloxi with pneumonia.  A Mrs. Havens from Pennsylvania, probably the wife of a cousin, was also a patient there.

In the summer of 1970 Eunice visited Reg and Verlie in Moss Point.  When reaching for a bathcloth in the bathroom her hip gave way and she fell.  Verlie was with her at the time.  

She was hospitalized for six weeks.  Sadly, in the Singing River hospital she developed pneumonia and died on June 9, 1970.  

The Jackson County Mortuary, owned by her son Reg, handled the burial services.  She is buried at the Pine Grove cemetery beside Walter.
