Christian was born in Choctaw Co., AL, the daughter of William Knealon Sims and Sarah Christian McGregor Sims.  She was born Mar 8, 1874.

Tragically, her mother died either in childbirth or shortly thereafter.  

On Aug. 9, 1877 her father married Mrs. Mary Savage Norden (b. Mar 1848 in AL; sister of Con and Moses Savage and widow of Thomas Norden (d. Dec 1870).  Thomas had adopted Josephine (b. 1862), "a child without known parentage" according to the adoption papers.  Her father adopted Josephine Norden.  (Later Josephine married C. I. Morgan.)

As a girl Christian became a fine musician.  She sang and played the piano well, according to her cousin Waldo Sims.

When she was 17, in December 1891, her father disappeared.  He departed to avoid the Sims tragedy that reached its climax on Christmas day.  He was completely innocent of any wrong-doing.

Christian and her step-mother sold a tract of land to A. J. Rogers for $40.  This transaction took place Jan 2, 1894.

On Dec 9, 1896, she married Charles Albert Nix (b. Jan 29, 1871; son of Little Berry Nix ;d. July 10, 1958).

Christian and Charlie's children were:

1) Lawrence Arty Nix (b. 23 Oct 1897; d. 28 Aug 1964 in AL; ll Nov 1923 md. Lily Mae Sterrett).
2) Dovie Ollie Nix (b. 2 Sept 1899; d. 16 Sept 1979 in Weber, Utah; 20 Apr 1929 md. Tom Lynch).
3) Claudie Lee Nix (b. 18 Oct 1901; d. 2 Feb 1938, killed in car accident; md. Wesley Ward McDonald; had 1 daughter, Janice). 
4) Evans Albert Nix ( b. 30 Mar 1907; d. Apr 1985 in San Jose, CA; md. Florence Milam; lived in CA)
5) Bingham Hazel Nix (b. Aug 24, 1909 in Wayne Co, MS; d. 22 Jun 1994 in Weber, Utah; 22 Sept 1934 md. Mabel Bouchard (b. Dec. 15, 1909)).
6) Edna Christian Nix (b. 22 July 1912 in Graceton, TX; d. 16 Apr 1914).

Charlie worked as a laborer.  For a while he cut cross ties for the railroad.

They were members of the Mormon church.

About 1907 they moved to Buckatunna in Wayne County in eastern Mississippi.  Charlie is listed in personal tax rolls that year. However because he owned no livestock, watches or taxable goods, he owed no taxes.

In 1908 they moved to Chicora, also in Wayne Co., MS.  Again they owed no personal taxes.  In 1909 they owned either a piano, organ or melodion valued at $100, possibly a gift.  They were accessed 60 cents for taxes.  With five babies in the house, this musical instrument gave Christian moments of pleasure.

In about 1911 they moved by train to Gracetown in Upshur County in northeast Texas, north of Longview.  It's possible that they moved there to be with her father who might have settled there when he fled from Alabama.

Christian died there August 9, 1913, probably of tb.  Bingham, aged 4, remembered his dad's horses and wagon hauling the coffin to the cemetery.  

She is buried in the cemetery at Ore City, TX.  It is situated on a hill top in the woods.  About 1989 a tornado destroyed the massive, tall pine trees in the cemetery.  The graves, arranged in straight rows, include many without markers.  One of those is Christian's. 

About 1917 Charlie and their children moved by train to Ogden, Utah.

On 6 Jan 1920 the census-taker recorded their family there in Weber Co.  Charlie, a widower, worked as a laborer at a sugar factory.  The family lived in a rented house at 262 23rd St. in Ogden.  The three youngest children attended school within the year.

After 1920 Charlie married Mary Ann Gwilliam to help raise the family.
