Born 19 Sept 1908, Ina was the first child of Vertie Lee and Andrew Campbell.  She was born in Harrison Co., MS. 

Although she was a good student, she only completed the eleventh grade.  As an adult she weighed about 140 lbs.

Once when Charles William "Charlie" Rushing came to see Ina, her 3 year old brother Donald was being given a bath.  He escaped from her sister as she was drying him and ran out on the porch.  In his birthday suit he entertained Charlie!
 
On 18 May 1927 she and Charlie (b. 26 Mar 1905) eloped.  On a Sunday evening while others went to church, they had Rev. W. W. Murray, a Methodist minister marry them.  Ina's sister Leo knew their secret plans.  After church when someone asked, where are Charlie and Ina, Leo burst out, I know, they went to get married!

Charlie was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Rushing.  He was a  congenial out-going man, according to Victor Sims.

He operated a dairy in the Cedar Lake community.  Later he worked for Ina's uncle, J. C. Hutchins (Andrew's sister, Laura's husband) in New Orleans.  He worked as a roofer.  For a while he drove a street car in New Orleans.

Ina and Charlie had the following children:

1) James Charles Rushing (md. Helen Geiger; live at Woolmarket, MS).
2) Wynona Rushing (md. Bunyon Pierce; live at Madison, AL).
3) William "Bill" Rushing (md. Anthony "Nita" Minor; live at Woolmarket, MS).
4) Luther Rushing (md. 1) Sue _____; divorced; 2) Pat _____).
5) Ervin L. Rushing (died as an infant 2 Aug 1936).

They were members of the Cedar Lake United Methodist Church.

Tragically, 26 Nov 1940, Charlie died.  He was working as a WPA foreman repairing the Back Bay bridge, when he became sick.  He succombed to pneumonia.  He's buried at Coalville Methodist Cemetery on Lorraine Rd. in Harrison Co., MS.  On the right side as you enter the large cemetery, his gravestone reads "Tho lost to sight, to memory dear."

Ina began working to support her family.  She worked for Eugene Krohn at Cedar Lake in his tomato fields.  He grew truckloads of produce that he sold locally. She worked at Moore Community House, a Methodist Community Center in Biloxi.  She served as a chaperon for Woolmarket School social events.  She worked as Director of activities for the USO during the war.

Later she worked at Keesler Air Force Base.  With a sewing machine she mended used parachutes.  She repacked them for reuse.  To pack them very tightly she used a board that pushed against her lower abdomen.  Later she had to have surgery several times in attempts to repair her urinary bladder due to this injury.

While she was at Keesler she worked to complete her GED exam to earn a high school diploma.  When she took the exam, she made the highest score made up to that time on the GED.

Ina loved camellias.  She rooted cuttings,  pollinated blooms, and grafted rootstock.  She grew many beautiful plants around her home.  She was active in the Gulf Coast Camellia Society.

As she aged, she remained active and interested in events.

Sadly, she died 12 April 1992.  She is buried at Coalville Cemetery beside Charlie.  Her gravestone reads, "Mother of Jim - Sis - Bill - Luke - Ervin."
