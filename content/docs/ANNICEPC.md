Annice was born in Marlboro Co., SC the daughter of William Henry Pearson and Sarah Pledger Steed Pearson.  She was born Oct 7, 1816.  Before she was 2, in May 1818, her father died suddenly.

Sarah married Daniel Britton, one of those appointed by the court to appraise Henry's estate.  Daniel either died or disappeared after 1821.

Sarah owned slaves.  They helped maintain the house and operate the farm.

On Feb 9, 1842 in Marlboro Co. Annice married Elias Campbell (b. July 4, 1814), a carriagemaker or wheelwright.  Annice received slaves from her mother.

Annice and Elias had the following children:

1) Elizabeth Ann Campbell (b. Nov 5, 1843; d. Nov 1929; md. Robert Sims).
2) Mary Jane Campbell (b. Mar 3, 1845; d. June 28, 1845).
3) James Alonzo Campbell (b. May 8, 1846; d. July 26, 1933; served in Co. C 8th AL Regt. in Civil War; md. Alice Emma Mills (b. Oct 10, 1851; d. Oct 23, 1916; had 7 children)).
4) Joseph Lawrence Campbell (b. Jan 30, 1848; d. Jan 20, 1897; Jan 24, 1878 md. Isadore Moseley (b. May 8, 1859; d. June 24, 1937).
5) Sarah "Sallie" Campbell (b. June 15, 1850; md. George Abel Lucas). 
6) William Gransy Campbell (b. Feb 16, 1852; handicapped by a fall when young).
7) Francis Jane Campbell (b. Mar 4, 1854; d. Nov 21, 1940; Dec 24, 1876 md. John J. Carney (b. Aug 7, 1852; d. Mar 10, 1888); had 5 children).
8) Annie Maria Campbell (b. Aug 15, 1857; d. 1939; Nov 8, 1876 md. Gabriel Carney (b. 1857, son of Harmon Carney; d. Apr 17, 1934); had 6 children; about 1916 divorced).
9) Henry George Campbell (b. July 30, 1860; d. 1945; May 21, 1885 md. 1) Harriet Moseley (b. Mar 31, 1861; d. Apr 17, 1934); had 6 children; 2) Mary Bonner; had 1 child).

Shortly after Dec. 1, 1851 the family moved to south Alabama.  Family legend reports that they lived in Wilcox County.

The Civil War imposed many hardships on rural families.  Because they had no salt, family legend reports that they mixed soil from the floor of the smoke house with water.  After the salt (that had fallen from the hung meat) dissolved in the water they poured off the water and boiled it to clean it.  Foods cooked in this water had a salty flavor.




Generally coffee was either not available or there was no money to purchase it.  Once when a child found 1 green coffee bean that had earlier been lost, they relished it.

Annice was as mad as fury when at the end of the civil war she was forced to release her slaves, according to her daughter Elizabeth.

Elias died Dec. 4, 1868.  He was buried in Hamrick Field cemetery south of the road from Barrytown to Souwilpa Creek.

Annice died Dec. 23, 1871.  The hardships and deprivation of the civil war probably shortened their lives.  Annice is buried beside Elias.  Sadly, both lie in unmarked graves.
