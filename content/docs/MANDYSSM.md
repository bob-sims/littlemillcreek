Mandy, the second daughter of William and Susan Hester Sims, was born in Bladen Co., NC. in 1837.  

In 1845 the family moved to Choctaw County in SW Alabama.

In 1856 she married James Slaughter (b. 1822 in NC).

They had the following children:

1) Betty Ann Slaughter (b. 1857; d. before 1870).
2) James L. Slaughter (b. 1859; d. before 1870).
3) Sarah Jane Slaughter (b. 1862; May 19, 1881 md. W. J. "Charlie" Chadwick, (b. 1859; d. 1913); moved to Waynesboro, MS).

On October 12, 1859, James bought land in township 11 range 2 west.  This transaction was recorded in book 77 at St. Stephens Land Office.

In the 1860 census James was listed as a farmer.  His real estate was valued at $200; his personal estate was valued at $2000.

James died in about 1862?.  He and the two older children may have died in an epidemic, such as yellow fever.
   
Private J. W. Slaughter from Co. K of the 2 MS Cavalary died Feb. 17, 1865, while held prisoner at Camp Chase near Columbus, Ohio.  He's buried in grave 1317.  (Is this our James Slaughter?)

In 1864 Mandy married Thomas J. Moseley.  Born Sept. 23, 1812, Tom was the son of Joab Moseley.  In about 1855 Tom had married Georganne Moseley (his first cousin; daughter of Sterling Moseley).  They had a daughter, Cummie, (b. 1856; 1880 md. Elijah Moseley, her first cousin) before Georganne died in 1863.  Thus this was the second marriage for both Mandy and Tom.

They had the following children:

1) Frank Moseley (b. Nov 25, 1865; homesteaded 80 acres of land; d. Sept 19, 1943; 28 June 1888 md. Elizabeth Sikes (b. 1872; d. Feb 9, 1958)).
2) Robert Cornelius Moseley (b. 1870; homesteaded 80 acres of land; d. Dec. 31, 1899).
3) Thomas Huel "Thracy" Moseley (b. 1874; md, but had no children; d. 1926 from burns from a papermill boiler explosion. (Family legend reports that he died while singing "Amazing Grace".))

Tom did not provide for his family.  According to his grandson, Chester Moseley, Tom "was no damn good".

The 1880 federal census found Mandy with three of her children (Sarah Jane, Cornelius and Thracy) living in the home of her brother Jim Sims.  Her son Frank lived with his uncle and aunt, Neal and Mary Sims.

Tom died August 1, 1889.

According to her grandson, Chester Moseley (Frank's son), in about 1900 at age 63 she was of average size and her brown hair had turned grey.  She would hold Chester (b. Jan. 23, 1893), a favorite grandchild, on her lap.

According to Nettie McEachern, she was a pretty, blue-eyed woman of medium size.  When older, she had wide hips.

Mandy died in 1909.  She is buried in Choctaw Co. at either the Bob Sims cemetery or the Adventist cemetery.  Sadly, there is no marker at her grave.
