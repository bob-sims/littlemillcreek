Reg was born Jan. 11, 1911, the second child and second son of Walter J. and Eunice Green.  He was named for Walter's father, Jackson Green.

He attended Broome School.

As an adult he was a small man.  His strength of character and straight-forward dealings compensated.  He was known for his firm handshake.

In 1936 he planned to marry Verlie Breland (b. Nov. 9, 1913 in Perry Co.), daughter of Lo Ernie and Thania Breland.  When he failed to appear at her home for the ceremony, Verlie got mad thinking that she had been jilted.

In fact, Reg had wrecked his car on the way to the church!  He drove his car into an unmarked missing culvert in the road, and was injured.  After his recovery in September, they married.

Their son Walter Verland Green was born Friday September 13, 1937. (The name Verland resulted from combining parts of his mother's name, "Ver" from Verlie with "land" from Breland.)

Reg farmed.  He maintained native wood's cattle.  These could find food for themselves in the river swamp.  With long horns they had various color patterns.  Reg kept bells on about 100 head in the swamp.

When the water would rise in the swamp he would go in a skiff to check on his cattle and move them to high ground.   This could be tricky, because he never learned to swim.  He told of finding himself in water over his head and walking out!

He had inherited land from his parents.  Over the years he bought more land.  He purchased land from Thomas Bilbo.  By selling timber he generated cash for purchases.  Red Creek joins Black Creek straight on.  This produces Black Creek.  About 3 miles from that junction Black Creek angles into the Pascagoula River.  Reg accumulated about 3000 acres of land in southern George Co. in the fork of Black Creek and the Pascagoula River.

During World War II Reg worked at the shipyard in Pascagoula.  He might have worked in the tin shop there.

In 1947 Reg campaigned for and was elected to the Board of Supervisors in George Co.  He represented Beat 5 where he lived.  The Board makes decisions about county affairs and controls the county budget.  He was conscientious and did a thorough job in this office.  The voters approved his high standards for road and bridge maintenance and he was reelected five times.  He served 24 years on the board!

About 1950 Reg borrowed money from the bank in Lucedale and built a commercial building in downtown Lucedale.  He rented it to Roy Graff who operated a Chrysler dealership there.  Reg had an agreement with the bank, allowing his tenant to pay rent directly to them.

Later he built a shopping center on Mill Street in Lucedale.  For several years his son Walter and his wife Peggy Wolfe Green operated a women's clothing store, the "Green Wolfe", there.  The arrival of discount stores more recently forced them out of this business.

About 1956 he opened a funeral home in Lucedale.  About 1959 he opened Jackson Co. Mortuary on North Pascagoula St. in Pascagoula.  It was a much nicer facility than the competition.  He sold the one in Lucedale to Alva Rouse about 1960.  

After several years he bought out his competition in Pascagoula, the Fails Funeral home.  He then ran both homes in Pascagoula and one that Fails had operated in Moss Point.

At first he and Verlie lived in an upstairs apartment over the business in Pascagoula.  Later they purchased a home in Moss Point.
They lived in Moss Point in August 1969 when hurricane Camille struck.  After they took care of their businesses it was too late to evacuate to a safer area.  They remained there through the storm.

About 1972 he and Verlie built a new brick home just north of their old home site.  The new house faced the Pascagoula River.  Walter and Peggy built a house about 1/2 mile west of them.

He sold the funeral homes about 1973.
 
His double first cousin that his parents raised, Huntley Green died Oct. 11, 1989.

Verlie suffered a heart attack in January 1990.  After six weeks of hospitalization she had a fatal stroke and died Feb. 20, 1990.  She is buried at Pine Grove Cemetery east of highway 57 in northern Jackson Co.

Reg died of a heart attack during the night and was found the next morning (Feb. 19, 1992) in his bed.  His funeral was on the same day as Verlie's two years later.  He is buried at Pine Grove Cemetery beside her.  Pink marble stones mark their graves.
