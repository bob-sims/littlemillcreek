Iggie was born November 11, 1882, in Choctaw Co. in SW Alabama the son of Robert and Elizabeth Campbell Sims.  He was their seventh child and third son.

After his father and older brother, Bailey's tragic deaths, the family moved to East central Mississippi.  Between 1892 and 1899 they lived in Waynesboro, Stonewall and Heidelberg.  In 1899 they moved to Estabutchie where they settled permanently.  

In 1969, when reminiscing, he enjoyed recalling the Redbud School in Waynesboro.  The school water supply was a stream a quarter of a mile down the hill from the building.  The students would wash their hands and faces there.  In winter, after he washed by the time he walked back to the schoolhouse, his hair would be frozen!

On the Mauldin place near Waynesboro he saw some of the first barbed wire.

When about 18 years old he developed pellegra.  It wasn't until 1925 that doctors associated it with its cause, a deficiency of the B vitamin, niacin.  He developed severe dermatitis and he lost his permanent teeth.  Thereafter he wore false teeth. 

Iggie bought a fiddle.  He got a musician to tune it for him once.  Thereafter he tuned it himself.  He said, "You can play any tune you can whistle."  He played the violin to entertain the family.  Mr. Hartfield kept the fiddle in good repair.  Later Iggie also owned a guitar and a banjo.  He picked the banjo.  Neighbors would borrow these for community dances.  When Elmer Moseley and Neal Beach stopped by for a visit, the former played the guitar, the latter the banjo and Iggie played his fiddle.  They enjoyed playing, "Sally Goodin", Bile Them Cabbage Down", "Ole Joe Clark", "Get Along Home Cindy" and "Ain't No Use in Kicking Up a Row".

President Teddy Roosevelt (in office from 1901 to March, 1909) came to Mississippi bear hunting.  On one of his trips Iggie shook his hand.  He was proud of that.

The 1920 census listed him as a farmer living next door on the Estabutchie Union Road to his mother, brother, Solie, and sister, Ruby.  That was the first house he built on 20 acres of land NE of Estabutchie.  (It was about one half mile from his second house.)

On January 14, 1923, Iggie married Margaret Emeline Taylor (b. Dec. 1, 1889 in Florida).  This was her second marriage.  Bruce Sims, his nephew, drove them to get married.  The ceremony was performed by O. F. Bradley, member of the Board of Supervisors in the home of W. E. Jones, blacksmith in Ellisville.

While Maggie kept their clothes clean, she was no housekeeper.  They never had any children.

About 1924 he contracted typhoid fever.  It was so serious that he nearly died.  Dr. Carr that practiced in Moselle possibly treated him.  It can be transmitted by flies that contaminate food with the bacterium.



Unlike his brothers, Iggie was a tall, slender man.  His illnesses may have limited his size.  He had a tender mouth.  He always ate sparingly, but he drank lots of milk.

He bought 40 acres of land down the road from his sister, Ruby's house.  It was covered with brush and stumps.  He cleared the brush and dynamited the stumps.  

Rural homeowners kept some dynamite on hand.  One hundred dynamite sticks came wrapped in wax paper packed in sawdust in a wooden box.  Dynamite (TNT) in a flame will burn, but not explode.  A concussion is necessary to make it explode.  The cap inserted into the stick provides the concussion.  The white fuse, twice wrapped black powder, is cut from a roll.  One end of the fuse is pushed into the cap.  With a string the fuse is tied to the stick of dynamite.  For other sticks to be detonated by that same cap, they must be in contact with that stick.

A hole was dug beside each stump.  Either the dynamite was placed in the bottom of the hole beside the stump or a it was inserted in a hole drilled in the tap root of the stump.  When the fuse was ignited, it exploded the stump.  One stick of dynamite would remove a 12" stump.

In the 1920's he grew 30-40 acres of cotton.  He provided houses for three tenant farmers.  Together they produced 25 to 30 bales of cotton a year.  After the cotton sale one year a car salesman came to Iggie's house to try to sell him a 1925 Oldsmobile.  Because money was so scarce in that economy, tenant farmers could not make enough to support themselves. 

He plowed his fields with a horse.  One of his horses was a 700# bay mare, named "Dimple".  Iggie bred her to Theron Collins, the mail carrier's, hamiltonian stallion and she had a male colt, "Jackson".  Her second colt, also a male named "Boston", was fathered by a wood's stallion.   A roan stallion owned by Ransy Murphy sired her third colt, another male.  Iggie traded this colt to Mr. Charlie Baylis for some cows.  The roan colt bled to death after Mr. Baylis gelded it.

His nephew Bruce introduced Iggie to his friend, Coy Kelley.  Bruce said, "Coy, I want to warn you that I. C. Sims is a trader.  He will take the socks off you, if you don't watch close!"  Not 6 months later Coy sheepishly came to Bruce wailing that Iggie had 
traded him out of a special dog.
 
For years (about 1922 to 1944) he slaughtered cattle.  At first he worked outdoors using a wooden tripod to hoist the carcasses.  Then he built a nice, screened slaughterhouse on the hill behind his house.  The wooden floor had a central iron trough that sloped to the rear allowing blood and waste water to drain down the hill into a sandy ravine.  One well supplied water to his house; a second supplied water to the slaughterhouse. It met the state health code.

He bought cows for slaughter from dairies and individuals.  He would kill a cow two or three times a week late in the afternoon.  Using a winch hooked to the carcass he would lift it and skin it quickly.  Hides were salted in barrels for later sale.  Animals were gutted.  He saved the livers, tripes, tongues and brains.  With a bone saw (a large hacksaw) the carcass was split down the middle of the back.  Halves were cut into quarters, each suspended by its own hook.

At daylight the next morning he would load up the quarters and deliver them to the meat markets in Hattiesburg.  He carefully cleaned the bed of his vehicle and covered it with a tarpaulin.  In the early years he used a horse-drawn wagon.  In about 1925 he bought his first truck, a model T Ford.  Built with a cab, Iggie added a wooden body.  Each quarter was wrapped in a clean white cloth sheet and laid on the tarp.  

About 1930 Iggie built his second house facing north on the 40 acres of land he had farmed.  It included 3 large rooms with two big porches.  He lived here the rest of his life.

In 1931 Victor, his nephew, gave him a female Boston Bulldog.  She was brindle-colored with a white breast.  Iggie named her "Snatch".  He sold her puppies for $5 each allowing him to pay off the mortgage on his farm!

Iggie became good friends with Maudie Lee Beeson Tyner.  About 1935 she had a son Robert.  Some said he resembled Iggie.

Over the years he had hauled worn tires, tire wrapping and trash from service stations.  He used the better tires and dumped the rest in a ravine across the road in front of his house.  He would back his truck up to a crosstie there and empty the truck.  During the second world war when tires were in very short supply he retrieved tires from this canyon, cleaned them, painted them and sold them.  He made $1100 selling tires!  He said, "The wise prosper, where starveth a fool."

At about the same time he sold bones.  Skulls, shank and feet bones from years of slaughtering had been bleached by the sun.  He sold them by the ton to a junk dealer in Laurel.    

During the 1950's Iggie bred, raised and sold registered white German shepards.  He advertized his dogs in national magazines.  He sold and shipped young dogs throughout the US, and to Mexico and Argentina. 

On the severely cold morning of January 9, 1970, Iggie collapsed while walking along the road in front of his house.  Sadly, he died, probably due to hypothermia.  The next night the temperature dropped to 8 degrees F, a record.  

Rev. Thompson conducted his funeral service.  He is buried at the Estabutchie cemetery in the plot with his mother and his brother, Solie, and his sister, Ruby.
