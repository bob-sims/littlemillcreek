Bill was born June 19, 1887, the son of Judge Henry Cooper Havens (b. Oct 15, 1831; d. Feb 7, 1912) and Rebecca Smith Davis Havens.   His father married first Josephine Bowen (b. June 10, 1830; d. May 9, 1879); they had 11 children.  His father then married Bill's mother, Rebecca.  Bill was the third of their 5 children.  Unfortunately, Rebecca (b. 1852) died Aug. 16, 1891.  His father then married Mary Franklin Cain (b. Feb 16, 1862; d. Jan 1929).  They had 4 children.  Thus Bill had 4 brothers and sisters and, amazingly, 15 half-brothers and half-sisters!

When about 20 years old he worked loading logs on a dummy line for the railroad.  He suffered a serious injury when a log smashed his leg.  It was amputated.  Thereafter he wore a wooden leg.  Because there were several in the community named Bill Havens, he was affectionately called Crippled Bill.

From 1912 to 1948, for 36 years Bill served as Circuit Clerk for Jackson Co.  He was elected and reelected many times.  He operated the Circuit Clerk's office in the Jackson Co. courthouse in Pascagoula.  In 1947 Vertis Ramsay was elected as his successor.  For 8 years he continued to work as a deputy circuit clerk under Vertis.

Bill married Iola Monteith (b. Oct 11, 1894) of Polk, MS.  She had come to Jackson Co. in 1920 as one of the first home demonstration agents in the county.  She was widely credited with introducing many methods and conveniences into rural homes.  She continued as a home demonstration agent until 1934.  They had no children.

Bill served as Clerk of First Baptist Church in Pascagoula in 1931, 1935, 1936 and 1954.  The Clerk maintains the membership rolls.

In 1932 Victor Sims met Bill at the Carterville precinct in northern Jackson Co. when he went to register to vote.

On May 22, 1933, "The Daily Herald" newspaper from Biloxi, MS included the following item:

"Mrs. W. C. Havens, county demonstration agent, and Dr. Landrum of Pascagoula visited the Daisy Vestry School Friday."

Sadly on Feb 15, 1953 Iola died after a long illness.  She was buried at Vancleave Cemetery No. 1 on Jim Ramsey Rd. in the plot with Bill's parents.

Later Bill married Dixie Gibson, a widow with grown children.  Her children were: Hazel Martinez of Moss Point, Bill Rodgers of Moss Point, John W. Gibson of Pasadena, TX and J. B. Gibson of Pascagoula.  (Tragically, later her son J. B. Gibson shot and killed his own 30 year old son who was on drugs, then killed himself.)

Bill and Dixie lived in a fine old home on River Rd. between Pascagoula and Moss Point.  The white two story colonial structure overlooked the water.

About 1965 he sold his home and built a brick home in Moss Point at 1304 McNair St.  The purchaser subdivided his waterfront acreage into lots for resale. 

Dixie died about 1970.

Bill moved into the county home.  After two weeks of hospitalization, sadly, he died at Singing River Hospital July 23, 1974.  He was 87.  O'Bryant-O'Keefe Funeral Home conducted the funeral.  He is buried at Vancleave Cemetery No. 1 beside Iola in the plot with his father and mother.
