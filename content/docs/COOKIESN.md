Cookie was born in December 12,1879 in Choctaw Co., Alabama the daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Sims.

She married Zadie Madison Norwood (b. 1862 in MS) about 1902.  He had a son Robert from his first marriage to a Native American woman.

They had the following children: 

1. Beatrice Helen Norwood (b. Nov 10, 1903; 1927 md. Lawrence Power). 
2. Phillip Norwood (b. 1905; md. Eleanor Oviatt (b. June 10, 1909 in Cleveland, Ohio)). 
3. twins, Max and Joe Norwood (b. Oct. 1908).  Max married Celina A. ____.  Joe married Helen Ojalla (b. Jan 25, 1904; d. Sept 16, 1993). 

Robert (b. about 1896) also lived with them.

Following the birth of the twins, she developed severe tuberculosis.  She was weakened by spasms of coughing.  She coughed up bloody froth.  For a while she slept in a half-walled tent in the backyard.  This provided fresh air and, because tb is contagious, this helped isolate her from the family.  Dr. Donald told her, "Mrs. Norwood, you won't ever die from tb."

About 1914 the family moved to a rented house at 141 West 5th St. in Hattiesburg.

Zadie did not provide for the family.  Her brother, Waldo, regularly sent a bushel of corn meal by the Southern railroad crew.  They knew to put it off in Hattiesburg at 7th St.  Her sister, Ruby, provided a little money periodically.  Both Ruby and their mother, Elizabeth, helped raise the children.

Phillip helped carpenters on building jobs.  Then he began painting.  He got a job painting for the railroad.  He and another boy lived in a railroad camp car that moved from one job to the next.

Cookie taught Bea shorthand from a stenographer's book.  About 1917 Bea went to work as a stenographer.  Cookie taught Joe to operate a telegraph.  At age 16 he began working for Western Union.  Their income helped support the family.

About 1922 her tb stabilized.  She had a hem-stitching machine and was able to do some sewing for other women.

Cookie was a small woman, but she had strength of character.  Her dark brown hair turned white.  She had a gravelly voice, possibly from her illness, and wore glasses.  Her strengths caused her children to excel.  Through all her troubles, her nephew, Victor, never saw her cry.  

In 1932 Zadie died and was buried in Long Beach, MS.

Cookie lived with her daughter and son-in-law Beatrice and Larry Power in Gulfport at the Great Southern Hotel.  After Larry died suddenly of a heart attack in June 1939, she moved to New Orleans to stay with Max and Celine.

About 1941 she moved to Trona, CA to be near Joe and Helen.  About 1938 Joe had moved there to work for American Potash & Chemical Company.  (Later it was bought out by Kerr McGee.)  Both Joe and Phillip became foremen there.  They worked for them until they retired.

Sadly, Cookie died of heart failure in 1965.  Her body was cremated.
