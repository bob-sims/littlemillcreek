Dora was born in 1877 in Choctaw Co., AL, the first child of John and Christian "Pinkie" Oates Sims (b. 9 May 1852; d. 16 May 1915).   
Her father's parents were William and Susan Hester Sims.  Her mother's mother was Lucinda Oates Taylor (b. 1832).

Her mother had two daughters when she married John Sims: Emma (b. 1872; md. Louis S. Trumbley; lived in East Lake, Michigan) and Mary Lena Kennedy (b. 15 July 1874, according to her tombstone, b. Mar 1883, according to the 1900 census; d. 11 Jan 1927, buried at Mt. Pisgah Cemetery near Melvin, AL; md. Frank M. McKenzie (b. 24 Nov 1867; d. 12 July 1951; son of Louis McKenzie) had 3 children: Leola P. (b. June 1900), Urban (a boy; b. 1902; md. Myrtis _____) and Frank M. (b. 1908).

Dora had a younger brother, Mike O. Sims (b. Oct. 1879), and a younger sister, Claudia Lee Sims.  Claudie Lee (b. Feb 1890) after Oct. 1906 married ____ O'Neal.  They moved to St. Cloud, FL.  Claudie Lee was a frequent letter writer.  We have a copy of a letter written to her by her cousin Joshua Oates.  She never had children, according to Mary C. Boney.

On 16 Apr 1896 Dora married Jehu R. Boney (b. Feb 20, 1878 in Choctaw Co.,AL).  He was the son of Owen and Mary Foster Boney.

He worked as a traveling salesman.

Their children included:

Marvin Boney (b.    ; md. Beatrice ____; lived in MI; had 2 sons).
Olive Boney (b. 1900; md. ____ ____; had 2 sons).
Michael Douglas Boney (b. 1902; md. Mary Agnes Crossman (b. 1909; d. Nov 1, 1996; had 2 sons: Michael Douglas Boney, Jr. of Hattiesburg and David Boney of Gulfport)).

As an adult Dora was a stately, black-haired woman, according to her cousin Victor Sims.  She was "despicable as a damn cuss", according to her cousin Iggie Sims.

In 1902 they lived at Lusk, AL.

Her brother Mike Sims (b. Oct. 1879) worked for the railroad.  On Apr 2, 1902, he was killed in a tragic freight train accident in Choctaw Co., AL.  He is buried beside their father John Sims.  A rock marks his gravesite.  The family was paid $1500 by J. M. Ackley representing the railroad as compensation for his death.  This was divided among his heirs, his mother and sisters.  

On 3 Sept 1904 Jehu applied to Probate Court in Choctaw Co. to become the guardian of Claudie Lee Sims.  He posted $400 in bond with the court.

The family moved to Hattiesburg, MS where they lived the remainder of their lives.  They lived on Railroad St.

Dora joined and became active in the Eastern Star.

Sadly, Jehu died Mar. 21, 1914.  Dr. L. B. Hudson cared for him.  According to his death certificate, he died of chronic nephritis (kidney disease).  He's buried at Oaklawn Cemetery in Forrest Co., MS.   

Dora's mother, who lived with them, died slightly more than a year later on May 16, 1915.  She's also buried at Oaklawn Cemetery.

Jehu had been designated to serve as executor of his mother-in-law's will (written Oct 13, 1906 and recorded, May 20, 1915), but his death prevented that.

The 1920 census, recorded Jan 24, 1920, listed Dora as a widow.  She lived at 110 First Ave. in Hattiesburg.  She owned her home mortgage-free.  Only Olive remained at home with her.

Sadly, Dora died 1n 1948.  Her tombstone in Oaklawn Cemetery is inscribed O E S (Order of Eastern Star).
