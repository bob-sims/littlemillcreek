Born 24 April 1839, Emmeline was the daughter of John "Jack" Havens and Sabra Fletcher Havens.  She was born north of Vancleave, MS in Jackson Co.  She was their fifth child.

In the 1850 census Emmeline was listed as attending school.

On 4 March 1853 she married Nathaniel Ladnier.  Born 4 May 1828, he was the son of Carlos and Annie Rester Ladnier.
 

They had 3 children:

1) Leonard L. Ladnier (b. 28 July 1857; d. 3 May 1940; md. Harriet "Hallie" Stewart (b. 26 Oct 1866; d. 15 Oct 1955); had 10 children, lived in LA).
2) Louisa Ladnier (b. 5 Dec 1860; md. Dr. Samuel James Dickson (b. 1850; d. 1 Oct 1900); had children; one son robbed a bank).
3) Albert N. Ladnier (b. June 10, 1862 or 1864; never married; a successful sheep raiser; known to be rough on roaming dogs that preyed on sheep; kept pretty (that is, well-fed) horses; according to Victor Sims, a fine, out-going man; d. Jan 13, 1943).

Unfortunately, her husband, Nathaniel died on 26 Feb 1865.  In his book, The Ladner and Ladnier Chronicles, Leonard Slade describes what happened.  

"I understand after Jeremiah Ladner was killed by Jay Halker's (sic) Nathaniel went in pursuit of them.  It was very bad weather and while crossing Wolf River, in the sleet and rain he froze in the saddle.  When he reached home they had to cut him from the saddle.  The exposure was to (sic) much for him, he developed pneumonia and died."

(Jayhawkers were raiders, originally from Kansas, who fought slavery by guerilla activity.)

About 1869 Emmeline married a second time.  Her husband was named either James Stephens or James Stephenson.  (Although the 1900 federal census and Cyril Cain gives his name as James Stephenson, the 1920 federal census and Emmeline's tombstone reads Stephens.)  They had 2 children.

1) Charles Stephens (b. 1870; md; moved to CA).
2) Delphine "Dell" Stephens (b. 1872; never married; lived with her mother and her half-brother, Albert; died in AL).

The family lived north of the New Prospect Campground east of highway 57 in northern Jackson Co.  In about 1920 Albert lived in a log house there.  Emmeline and Dell lived in a newer frame house.  
They operated a general store there.  A building on the road served as the store.  They sold staples such as flour, rice, sugar, salt and coffee.  Dell did most of the work in the store.

About 5' 3" tall, in about 1925 Emmeline weighed about 135 lbs.  She had long hair.  She wore long skirts with blouses and a hand-made bonnet with staves to stiffen its wide brim.  

She had a spinning wheel.  She had a sewing machine.  Her home was lovely with fine furnishings.  (Later our family purchased a pretty clear pressed glass set from Dell.  It includes a tall pitcher, a cream pitcher, a sugar bowl with a lid and a spoon holder.)

Her great nieces Elsie Havens Fletcher (b. 1913) and Inez Havens Sims (b. 1916) as girls often rode Bonnie, a bay mare, to visit her.  The trip was about 4 miles, so they would spend the day.  Sometimes Dell would make homemade vanilla ice cream.  Ice from Vancleave was kept in an icebox.  Sometimes Albert would kill and dress a sheep.  The girls would carry a quarter of fresh mutton home in a sack to their parents.  Sometimes they would go to get a bag of ripe mellow pears from their Aunt Emmeline's pear trees for their family.

Emmeline died June 1, 1930.  She is buried at the cemetery at her homeplace.  In 1997 her headstone with her first husband's and her son Albert's stands in the shaded corner of a cattle pasture, a tranquil spot.
