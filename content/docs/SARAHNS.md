Sarah was born in 1834? probably in SW Georgia.  She and her older brother William Nixon (b. 1827), according to family legend were orphan Native Americans.  Because SE Alabama and SW Georgia were controlled by Creeks, I assume that they were members of that tribe.

In Barbour Co., AL on January 28, 1847, she married Andrew Jackson Smith (b. 1827; the son of Reddick and Mary Clarke Smith).

In 1851 they moved with Reddick and Mary and their family and Jackson's brother James and his family to Jasper Co, MS.  They settled near Montrose.

Both the censuses of 1860 and 1870 report that although Jackson could read and write, Sarah could not.

Sarah and Jackson had the following children:

1) Sarah A. Lucinda (b. 1848 in Barbour Co., AL) (1866 md. James Sylvester Walley; Civil War veteran.)
2) Rebecca A. "Becky" (b. 1850 in AL) (md. Andrew Jackson Knotts (his second wife)).
3) Robert R. (b. 1852) (md. Alice McCarty).
4) Dicy Wiggins (a girl) (b. 1854) (md. Steve Rich).
5) Samantha "Manse" (b. 1856) (md. Perry Harper).
6) George Washington (b. 1858) (1880 md. Susan Sumrall (b. 1864)).
7) Andrew Thomas "Tanner" (b. 1860, d. 1932) (1880 md. Margaret Bates b. 1856?).
8) Carey E. (b. 1862) (Betty md. George Sumrall; Is this her?)
9) Emily Rosanne "Millie" (b. 1864) (1880 md. Elisha E. Sumrall (b. 1859)).
10) Aura Ophelia "Oph" (b. 1866) (md. Calvin Nixon, her first cousin).
11) William Greenberry "Bud" (b. 1869) (md. (1) Florence Cornelia Fore (b. 14 Feb 1870; d. 24 July 1899); (2) Florence Cornelia McCord (b. Sept. 9, 1879)).
12) Mary Iva "Pet" (b. 1871) (md. Henry Judson Knotts (son of Jack Knotts above and his first wife)).
13) Cynthia D. "Sis" (b. 1875) (md. Singleton "Sink" Anderson (son of T. W. Anderson)).
14) John Calvin (b. 1878) (md. Anna McCarty).

The family grew a little tobacco.  According to her grandson, Shuford Nixon, she smoked a clay pipe every night before going to bed.

Family legend suggests that Sarah died of pneumonia.  She is buried at Palestine Cemetery, but has no marker.
