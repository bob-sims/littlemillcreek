Mattie was born in 1886 in Choctaw Co., AL the daughter of James Sims (b. 1850) and Nancy Elizabeth "Betty" Bazoon Sims (b. Nov 15, 1862; d. Nov 7, 1943; daughter of William and Francis Bazoon).  Mattie's parents were married April 5, 1882.

Later Betty Lighthall recalled her grandmother, Betty Sims, as of average height and weight with her white hair fashioned into a bun.  She made quilts and tended a beautiful vegetable garden.  She was a wonderful person who enjoyed giving away vegetables from her garden.  The neighbors kindly referred to her as "Miss Betty".

Mattie had an older sister, Rena Sims (b. Nov 1883) and a younger brother, Tolstoi ("Tolly") (b. May 1889).

After her father's death in 1891, on Nov 8, 1895 her mother married Sam O. Rogers (b. Mar 29, 1874; d. Oct 2, 1959).  The ceremony was performed at her home.  Betty and Sam had two children: Sada O. (b. Mar 1896; md. Floyd Wallaker; no children), her half-sister, and Boyer Earl (b. Oct 1897; md. Verna _____; had 7 children), her half-brother. 

About 1901 Mattie married David Perry Nordon (b. Dec 7, 1877; son of ______ (d. before 1917) and George W. Nordon (d. 1926)).  Physically he was a big man.  In the 1900 federal census Perry was described as a teamster.  

They lived their entire lives near Gilbertown in Choctaw County.  Their home was about one half mile from the center of Gilbertown.

Later Sam began to sell her father's land (about 1000 acres).  Mattie refused to sign papers relinquishing her interest in mineral rights in the land.  

Mattie and Perry had the following children:

1) Ruby Nordon (b. Aug 25, 1902; md.1) ______ Schribner, 2) ______ Blue).
2) James Tolstoi "Tolly" Nordon (named for his mother's brother; b. Jan 18, 1905; md. Bertha ______).
3) Caroline "Callie" Nordon (b. 1907; in 1998 lives in Pennington, AL in a nursing home; md. Thomas Benjamin Singley (b. 1903).
4) Irene Nordon (b. 1909; d. Apr 4, 1995; md. 1) A. W. Sykes, 2)______ Green).
5) Cleo Nordon (a boy; b. Mar 29, 1912; d. 1974?; md. Lucille Stokley).
6) John Perry "J. P." Nordon (b. Sept 21, 1914; md. Verna Mae ______ (lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico).
7) Nancy Elizabeth "Betty" Nordon (b. Jan 4, 1917; 1940 md. Byron Lighthall (b. May 1, 1918; a Seventh Day Adventist Minister); has 3 sons; in 1998 lives in St. Cloud, Minnesota).
8) Nathan Nordon (b. Apr. 18, 1918; d. Apr. 20, 1918).
9) Claude William Nordon (b. Oct 6, 1920; md. ______; separated; lived in Mobile, AL; d. in 1986 in VA hospital in Gulfport, MS).
10) William Lynn Nordon (b. Jun 21, 1923; md. Vermell Adams; lived in Coker, AL).
11) Bernice Wilma Nordon (b. Mar 7, 1926; d. Jun 9, 1947 of TB).

Early in 1923 Mattie became a devout Christian and joined the Seventh Day Adventist Church.  According to her granddaughter Jesse Cooper, she would sit in a rocker or swing on the porch with a pencil and paper and her Bible.  She frequently recorded what happened on paper, a fine habit.

Sadly, her tenth child Lynn was born with clubbed feet.  She grieved, fearful that he would never be able to walk.  Then she began to pray.  Ultimately, a Dr. Barres from Texas came to their house, made shoes with braces and operated on Lynn.  After healing, the boy was able to walk normally.  

Then in 1926 when Bernice was born she had one clubbed foot and one slightly bent foot.  The doctor that delivered her put tape on her best foot and it straightened.  After unsuccessful effort and fervent prayer, she was treated by Dr. Hannon in a hospital in Mobile, AL.  The family has Mattie's 8 page record, written about 1932 of these events, a treasure.
