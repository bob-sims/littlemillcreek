Born March 27, 1916, Margaret's birth name was Nancy Sasser.  She was the oldest child.  Her parents lived in Baxterville in Lamar County and in the Bowie River community west of Seminary, MS.  (The Bowie River forms the boundary between Jeff Davis Co. on the west and Covington, Co. on the east before it runs into the Leaf River in Hattiesburg.) 

Her dad, a laborer, collapsed and died of a heart attack on the front porch while carrying groceries into the house.  He was only 27 years old!  Her mother died giving birth to a younger brother.  
The two babies were taken in by Van Carter (b. 1889) and Martha Carter (b. 1892), Margaret's aunt, her mother's sister, and her husband and their five children.  During the year among all those cousins, Margaret learned to fend for herself.  After a year her brother was adopted by the family of a railroad worker in Jackson, MS.  Margaret went to live with Joe A. (b. 1858) and Beulah Carter (b. 1870), her step-grandfather and grandmother in Seminary.

Joe and Beulah both had children when they married.  He had at least two sons (Van and another who died in World War I); she had at least two daughters (Margaret's mother and Martha Carter).  Joe and Beulah had a son Jesse (b. 1908), Margaret's mother's half-brother.  He was a carefree boy envied by other boys because he went hunting when they went to school!  As an adult Jesse operated a tent movie show moving from town to town.  

Joe and Beulah lived near the cotton gin and Waldo and Idell Sims's house.  Beulah's mother, Mrs. Mary Whitehead Williamson lived with them.  Joe  played the fiddle and Van played the guitar to entertain the neighbors.  

With the benefits obtained from the government after the death of his son in the war, Joe bought and stocked a grocery store in Seminary.  They operated this store.  (Years later they sold the store to Lee Speed.  It stood on the location in 1995 of David Daniel's store.)

Shortly after coming to live with her grandparents, Margaret began visiting the Sims next door.  Her visits became longer and in essence she adopted them.

She was a spunky kid, one that would speak up and participate.

She attended school first in Seminary and after 1930 in Hattiesburg.

After the family moved in 1932 to Jackson County, she attended Daisy Vestry School north of their home.  She rode the school bus driven by John Fairley to school.  She was smart in schoolwork.

Margaret married Marvin Ernest Vaughn (b. March 22, 1913; son of Rev. Robert Lee and Sarah Taylor Vaughn of Vancleave).

At first they lived in a small house Marvin built on his Dad's land.

Marvin worked at Ingall's shipyard as a carpenter in maintenance.  After a routine layoff, when rehired he began as a shipfitter in the fabrication shop.  Shipfitters fitted ship parts together.  Each had a tacker who worked beside him to anchor the metal pieces.  Later a welder permanently welded the seams.

Over the years Marvin worked his way up to superintendent of the fab shop.

Margaret and Marvin had two children:

1) Marvin "Buddy" Vaughn (b. 1938; md. Ann Penton; had two children, Cindy and Mark; divorced).

2) Barbara Ann "Babs" Vaughn (b. August 2, 1939; md. Steve Moon; had two sons, Russell and Kevin; divorced; lives in Bonita Springs, FL).

About 1942 Margaret divorced Marvin.

In 1943 she lived with her babies in Victor Sims' house beside Waldo and Idell Sims on Sims Mill Pond Rd.  Babs was able to climb up on top of an old-fashioned upright piano in the house!

In Fort Worth, TX, Margaret had Janna L. Brown (b. 1945; md. Leroy A. "Slick" Carron; had 2 children; divorced).  In August 1947 in Bay St. Louis Margaret married Bernard J. "Bernie" Keifer (b. March 23, 1910), a native of Louisville, Kentucky.  He served as Janna's Dad.  Bernie sold cars.

Bernie and Margaret lived in Pascagoula in 1953-54.  About 1955 they moved to Biloxi.  (The family first appears in the Biloxi City Directory in 1956.)  She lived there the remainder of her life.

She began to spell her name "Marguerite".  Both spellings appear in various records.

In Biloxi, she took oil painting lessons.  She produced some good paintings.  Her first painting showed a table top with a piece of driftwood, a book and a bottle of wine.  She entitled it "Strength, knowledge and levity".

In 1958 they lived at 2945 Vaughn St.  Bernie was manager of Porter Ave. Auto Sales.  

In 1961 they lived at 215 Vine St.  With C. F. Speer, Bernie owned and operated Keifer & Speer Motors at 120 Lameuse St.

Like her father, Margaret had heart problems.  Her cigarette smoking exacerbated her condition.  She took medication for several years.  However the problem grew worse, and she died suddenly at 5 am at home in Biloxi April 10, 1961.

She's buried at Machpelah Cemetery in Pascagoula in the Sims plot.  Janna placed a granite marker at her mother's grave.

Bernie remains (in 1996) in good health and, remarkably, at age 86 continues to sell cars.  He's currently employed at Universal Motors on Dedeaux Rd. in Gulfport, MS.

Sadly, Marvin Sr. died January 28, 1996.  He's buried at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, north of Vancleave.
