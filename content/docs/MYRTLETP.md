On Dec 14, 1918, Myrtle was born in Purvis, MS, the oldest child of Fred Lemuel Todd (b. 15 Nov 1893; d. 14 Dec 1975) and Charlotte "Lottie" Horton Todd (b. 30 Sept 1898; d. 14 Dec 1972).  Myrtle was born at the hotel in Purvis operated by Laura Horton, her grandmother.  Fred was a 1st Lt. in the army at that time.

Later she had a younger brother, Fred L. Todd, Jr. (b. 21 Oct 1920 in Jackson, MS; md. Jeanette Weaver) and a sister, Marion Louise Todd (b. 12 Sept 1922 in Jackson, MS; md. James Louis Tyler (b. 12 Dec 1916)).

When her Dad retired from the army, he began working for the YMCA in Jackson, MS.  He served as a director of the "Y".

Myrtle attended school in Jackson.  

The family visited the Waldo Sims family in Seminary.  (This was Lottie's uncle and aunt.)  They drove a Willis-Knight car.  Myrtle went swimming there.

Myrtle was a beauty.  She was elected Miss Mississippi State Fair for 1935.

She graduated from Central High School in Jackson in 1936.  Her class included about 304 students. 

She attended Belhaven College.  Because she first majored in business and then changed to home economics, it took her five years to graduate.

Her parents divorced and her dad remarried.

On 25 May 1941, Myrtle married Sidney Preston (b. 9 Nov 1916; d. 13 Dec 1983), a military man.

They had the following children:

1) Benjamin Cary Preston (b. 9 Nov 1943 in Venice, FL).
2) Diane Elizabeth Preston (b. 3 Feb 1945 in Jackson, MS; md. Thomas Joseph Snee; had two sons; Diane and her husband are now divorced: 
a. Thomas Joseph Snee, Jr. (b. 12 Oct 1970).
b. Preston Todd Snee (b. 28 Oct 1972).
3) John Preston (b. 4 July 1951; 29 Jan 1977 killed tragically in a small plane crash in TN).

The family lived in several cities as they followed military service.  They enjoyed a tour overseas in the Panama Canal Zone.  Myrtle remembered that the climate there included only two seasons.  The military supplied a fine two story house.  Although it lacked air conditioning, air naturally circulated through window blinds, to make the house comfortable.   To keep certain items such as pianos dry and protect them from the high humidity, a light was suspended within them.

In the Canal Zone she remembered attending a reception for General and Mrs. Dwight Eisenhower.  When she shook hands with them, Mrs. Eisenhower impressed her as a friendly woman.

In about 195l they moved to Mobile, AL.  They lived first in an apartment on Kittyhawk Ave.  Her Pruitt cousins, her Aunt Ruby Pruitt, Uncle Kenneth Horton and her grandmother Laura Horton lived there.

She and her husband divorced.

About 1954 she moved to a house at 162 Emogene Place in Mobile.  The house, built from materials designed for ships, includes paneling and special light fixtures.

Myrtle worked for the AL Power Company for 23 years.  She used her home ec training as a home service advisor.  She taught people how to used electric appliances and timers.  In 1981 "home service advisors" became "energy advisors" and their duties included work in the attic of homes.  That year Myrtle retired. 
 
About 1990 Myrtle developed an interest in genealogy.  She collected materials and prepared family books for her children.

In 1996 she flew to Jackson to attend the 60 anniversary celebration of her high school graduating class!.  Forty of her classmates attended.  The old Central High building is now being rennovated as the state Dept. of Education building.

For Christmas 1997 Ben from Mobile, Diane from Ashville, NC and her grandchildren returned to her home for the holidays.  This special reunion was described in an article in the "Mobile Register".
