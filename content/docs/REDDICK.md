Reddick was born in 1790 or 1793 probably in Georgia.  His parents names are unknown.  Family legend suggests that his father emigrated from Ireland.  Traveling on another ship, his wife and children were lost at sea when that vessel sank.  He remarried and his second wife was Reddick's mother.

In 1811 Reddick married Polly Hall from Green Co., GA.

Tragically Polly died, possibly in childbirth, about 1815.

In 1816 Reddick married Mary Clarke (b. 1805 in Georgia).

Reddick's known children include: 

1) James H. (b. 1812 in GA; md. 1)___ _____, 2)1843 Mary Johnston ? (b. 1822)). 
2) John R. (b. 1818 in GA; 1836? md. 1) Martha _____, 2) 1868 Julia Ulmer). 
3) Andrew Jackson (b. 1827 in AL; 1847 md. Sarah Nixon; Civil War Veteran). 
4) Reddick Jr. (b. 1831; 1857 md. Martha Bates (b. 1838); Civil War Veteran). 
5) Almira (b. 1836). 
6) Francis M. (a male), (b. 1838).
7) Thomas (b. 1841).
8) Soloman Q. (b. 1843; md. (1) in 1862 Anna G. Bates (b. 1844), (2) in 1871 S. A. D. Wedgeworth).

In 1830 a Reddick Smith and his family lived in Pike Co., AL.  Pike County now lies west of Barbour Co., AL.  Barbour Co. was formed in 1832 from Creek cession.  This Reddick had 2 sons under 5; 2, 5 to 10; 1, 10 to 15; 1, 15 to 20; and 1 daughter 5 to 10.  His is listed as 30 to 40 and his wife is 40 to 50, a mistake, if this is our Reddick.

He sold land in section 5, township 10, range 28 in Barbour Co. in Dec 1835.  This transaction was recorded in Deed Book A, p. 189.

In 1840 Reddick and his family reside in Barbour Co., AL.  They have one son under 5; 1, 5 to 10; 2, 10 to 15; 1, 15 to 20, and one daughter under 5.  He is given as 40-50 and Mary as 30-40.  Four in the family are employed in agriculture.  (This is definitely the family that later moved to Jasper Co., MS.)

In 1850 the federal census of Macon Co., AL recorded Oct. 31, 1850, lists Reddick as a farmer aged 60.  His real estate is valued at $3400.  Mary's age is given as 36, again a mistake.  Five children remain at home and their son John, a carpenter, and his wife, Martha live next door.  (The children's names confirm that this is our man.)
In 1851 he was listed as a landowner in Barbour Co, AL. (sec 24, twsp 12, ran 25).  

In 1851 Reddick moved his family to Jasper Co. Mississippi.  They settled near Montrose.  His sons James and Andrew Jackson also moved their families to Jasper Co.

In addition to farming, he began to preach in Baptist churches.  In Jasper Co. he and his son Jackson helped organize the Palestine Baptist Church.  One of them gave the land on which the present church stands.  
"Palestine Church was first a bush arbor.  After which a split 	log church was built.  it was about twenty by thirty feet with 	two doors and two windows with plank shutters.  Seats were 	made from split logs.  The church standing in 1932 was built 	in 1888."  Quote from lost book copied by Ora Smith.
 
His name appears in Jasper Co. tax records from 1856.  Poll taxes were accessed for white males aged 21 to 50.  He is enumerated with 5 cattle, no slaves and no polls.  Because he is over 50, he no longer pays poll taxes.  His total tax was accessed at $.05.  He paid $.01 each for his cows!

The 1860 census taken 20 July 1860 records Reddick as a farmer aged 67.  His real estate has a value of $6000 and his personal estate a value of $900.  Mary, aged 55, and their youngest sons, Thomas and Soloman, both farm laborers, complete the household.

The 1860 federal agricultural census (for Jasper Co.) described his farm.  He owned 70 acres of improved land, 570 acres of unimproved land.  His farm was valued at $6000.  The following values were assigned: farm impliments and machinery, $125; livestock, $700; animals slaughtered, $40.  His livestock included 2 horses, 2 mules, 2 milk cows, 2 oxen, 4 other cattle, 2 sheep, 25 hogs.  During the previous year his farm produced 300 bushels of corn, 10 bushes of peas and beans, 10 bushels of irish potatoes, 30 bushels of sweet potatoes, 25 400# bales of ginned cotton, 104 lbs. of butter and 1 ton of hay.

Reddick died in the Spring of 1864.  His was the first grave in Palestine Cemetery.

Mary became blind in her advanced years.  She died in 1884 and is also buried at Palestine Cemetery.
