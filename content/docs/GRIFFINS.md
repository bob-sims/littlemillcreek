On 8 Feb 1775 John Moultrie et al sold a tract of land to Wm. Gickie.  Earlier it had been conveyed by William Steed to William Saunders, deceased.  Wm. Gickie paid 5030 pounds SC money for what was described as 750 acres.  It actually contained 832 acres plus 61 acres of adjacent marsh.  This is the first record I've found of Griffin Steed.

Griffin is not listed in the 1790 or 1800 federal censuses from Marlboro Co., SC.

Griffin married Sarah Pledger (b. between 1780 & 1790; possibly the orphan daughter of the late John Pledger).  Griffin and his wife had one known child:

1) William Griffin Steed Jr.(b. 1805?; md.      (b. 1812?); in 1840 and 1850 farmed in Marlboro Co., SC; had at least 4 children; (either this Griffin or his son Griffin died before 1868 when his widow Martha (b. 1844) md. Henry Pearson, nephew of William Henry above)).

Griffin Sr. died early in 1810 (before April 2) in Marlboro Co., SC.   His wife Sarah and Wm. Henry Pearson served as administrators of his estate in probate in the Court of the Ordinary.  Sarah married Wm. Henry Pearson.

Following his death the court appointed F. Britton, Wm. Brown and John Brown to serve as appraisers of his estate.  They listed his goods and chattels giving the value of each.
