St. Cyr (pronounced Sancher or Sancere) was born in 1788 the only child of Jose Zamora (or Charles LeBlanc) and Genevieve Baudreau.  They were married in 1783.
 
His mother was the daughter of Jean Baptiste Baudreau Graveline (b. 1736) and Mary Louise Fayard (b. 1746).  Because her parents didn't marry until 1801, her name appears as Baudreau at times and as Fayard at other times, according to Brother Lepre.  

His mother, Genevieve's grandparents were: Jean Baptiste Baudreau and Catherine Vinconneau Baudreau and Jean Fayard and Francoise Fisseau Fayard.

His father was the son of Thomas LeBlanc and Perinne ___ LeBlanc of Pennsylvania.

As an adult St. Cyr's name was given as Seymour, Zamour and in Jackson Co. land deeds as Joseph S. Moore (Volume III, p. 28).  Because so many folks couldn't write or spell, the name was recorded as it sounded.  These variations are pronounced similiarly.  

Brother Lepre (1995) believes that St. Cyr changed his name.  The first names he found recorded were LeBlanc, Blanc or White, the translation of those.  It's possible that as they were white men, in dealings with Native Americans, Blacks and Creoles, the family was referred to as white.

On 28 June 1808, St. Cyr married Marie Joseph Ryan (b. March 19, 1786), the daughter of Jacque (or Jean) Ryan and Marie Gargete (or Gargare).  Her dad was deceased at the time of her marriage.  According to Brother Lepre, they were married at St. Mary's Church on Chartres St. in New Orleans by the Rev. Jean Olivier.

St. Cyr and Marie lived in Latimer (also called Belle Fountain) (in section 5, township 8 south, range 9 west) in Jackson County.  Their land extended into Harrison County.

In 1819 St. Cyr paid $1 in state taxes for one white poll and $.50 in Jackson county taxes.  On the record his name was spelled "Sanser Semore".

They had the following children:

1) Edward Seymour (b. 1808?; 1833? md. Adele Fournier).
2) Pierre Saucier Seymour (b. Dec. 23, 1810; 1834 md. Mary Louise Fournier (b. 1820?)).
3) John (or Jean) Baptiste Seymour (b. 1813; d. Oct. 14, 1887; 1835? md. Marie Fournier (b. 1820?)).
4) Lazarus Seymour (b. Apr. 18, 1816; d. Apr. 26, 1902; md.  1845? 1) Nancy Seaman (d. June 4, 1853; had 4 children), 2) Elizabeth Fayard (had 9 children); operated a meat market in North Biloxi).
5) Victoria Seymour (b. Jan. 24, 1820; md. Narcisse Fayard).
6) St. Cyr II Seymour (b. Aug. 11, 1827; md. 1) 1847 Anna McCarthy, 2) Victoria Deloney.)
7) Josephine Seymour (b.     ; md. Charles Fayard).


St. Cyr died January 1, 1845 from an accident on board a ship caught in a storm.  Barrels covered the deck.  The barrels tore loose, struck him and he suffered internal injuries.  He was dead when the ship arrived in harbor.  He is buried at the old Biloxi Cemetery on the beach in an above ground concrete vault beneath an old cedar tree.  His is possibly the oldest grave in the cemetery.  The inscription in french gives his name as St. Cyr Zamour.

Marie lived to be an impressive 102!  Her death date Mar. 28, 1876, makes her only 90.
