Ben was born November 21, 1878, the oldest child of Joseph Lawrence Campbell (b. Jan 30, 1848) and Isadore Moseley Campbell (b. May 8, 1859; d. June 24, 1937).  His parents were married Jan 24, 1878 by the Rev. W. G. Powe.  Ben was born in Toxey in Choctaw, Co., AL.

His father Joe was the son of Elias Campbell, a wheelright, and Annice Pearson Campbell; his mother Isadore was the daughter of Benjamin David Moseley (d. 24 Feb 1884), a prosperous landowner, and Mary Ann Bonner Moseley.

Ben's brothers and sisters were: Mary Annis "Molly" (b. 1880), Andrew Bonner (b. 1882), Thomas Edgar (b.7 Sept 1883; d. 16 Oct 1956), Martha Ellen ("Mattie", b. 1886), Joseph Lawrence, Jr. (b. 1888), Clarence David (b. 1890), and Laura Montez (b. 1893).

The family lived at Butler; then on 40 acres on the west side of Oaktuppa Creek.  They built a home there surrounded by a rail fence.  The beavers cut the fence in two!

Later they lived in Meridian, MS in two homes.  After Isadore sold 40 acres she had inherited from her dad, they bought a place and moved to Sand Flat, six miles from Meridian near Bonita, MS.

Benjamin and his brothers Joe and Edgar provided music for Saturday night community dances.  One played the violin and another the harmonica.

His dad died tragically on January 20, 1897, when Ben was only 18 years old.  Joe's sister, Annie, had married Gabe Carney.  Joe roofed their house with wooden shingles in a freezing rain.  From exposure he got a fatal case of pneumonia.  He's buried at the Long Creek Baptist Church southeast of Meridian, MS.  A granite tombstone marks his grave.

As an adult Ben was about 6' tall and weighed about 175 lbs.  Later his niece, Jean Brown, described him as a special man with an inner light.

About 1904 Tom Hardin, a businessman from the coast, went to Meridian and bought a portable sawmill.  He asked the owners to suggest the best man to install it.  They highly recommended Ben Campbell.  He moved to the coast to set up the mill at Woolmarket.  They cut and sawed timber from 16th section land in both Jackson and Harrison Counties.

With the money from his first checks, he bought some land in Woolmarket.  With materials from the sawmill he built a cabin.  Then he moved his mother and younger brothers and sisters to his house.

He always enjoyed fishing.  When wadeing in Graveline Bayou to gig flounders, he had an accident.  He was speared in the back of his calf above his shoe top by a large stingray.  He said that if he had not been braced, it would have towed him out to sea!  After the wound healed a large scar remained.  His calf had a depression the size of a walnut.  This wound served as a weather barometer.  It became painful prior to weather changes!

Ben married Ophelia Scarborough (b. July 1, 1888) on November 28, 1906 in Jackson Co., MS.  She was the oldest child of Albert G. (b. May 1864) and Margaret Anne Seymour Scarborough (b. June 1867).  (Anne was Calvin Seymour's sister.)  One friend described her as the prettiest girl in the county and him as the most eligible bachelor. 

On November 27th they applied to Fred Taylor, Jackson Co. Clerk of Circuit Court, for their marriage license.  Rev. P. A. Sibley performed the ceremony.

He worked for the Gulf States Creosote Co. on Creosote road in 
Gulfport until his retirement.  He was a carpenter/millwright.  For many years they lived in a white frame two-story house in the NE corner of the intersection of Pass Rd. and Teagarden Rd. in Gulfport. 

They had the following children: 

1) Eddie Marie (b. 27 Dec 1908). Eddie Marie taught music first at the Handsboro school; From Fall 1933 she taught music and penmanship at the Fernwood school in Gulfport; married H. C. Meek; tragically, she died 1 June 1943 in Dallas, TX, after childbirth.  Her newborn baby girl, Anne Marie Meek (b. 1943) was raised by Ben and Ophelia.  Her Dad sent money to contribute to her care.
2) Joseph Albert (b. 1 Aug 1910; d. 23 Feb 1970) Joe married Nell Prine (b. 4 Apr 1904; d. 18 Apr 1979); they adopted a son, Joseph; and from 1949 to 1966 he worked for Ingall's shipyard in Pascagoula.  At the time of his death he was employed by Avondale Shipyard in Metairie, LA.
3) Julius D. (b. 1912?) Julius married Nancy Collier (d. 1981); they had two sons, Julius Douglas Jr. (b. 1947) and Kenneth; tragically, he was struck and killed by a car in 1961 when crossing highway 90 in Gulfport in front of the Holiday Inn that they managed.

Their neighbors, Perry and Edna Castle, admired Ben.  Mr. Castle said that he would rather have a skiff that Ben Campbell built that anyone else in the world!

In 1936 Ophelia worked as a clerk at J. C. Penny's in Gulfport.  Ben got home before Ophelia and he would begin cooking supper.  He enjoyed cooking.

In 1946 Ben retired.  His boss asked him to bring in his first social security check.  Thereafter Gulf States Creosote gave him a matching retirement check each month.

He and Ophelia first operated a country store on highway 49 in Bond for one or two years.

About 1950 they moved into a navy house at 1002 Lincoln Ave. (now Ingalls Ave.) in Pascagoula to be near their son Joe.  Ann Marie attended school and graduated from Pascagoula High in June 1961.

Ophelia worked at J. C. Penny Department Store in Pascagoula.

They were members of the Eastlawn Methodist Church.

About 1950 when parakeets first became widely available they had one.  Ben enjoyed its antics playing on a miniature ladder.

He continued to fish.  After the catch was cleaned, he would fry it. 

Like his brother, Andrew, Ben developed asthma as he aged.

Sadly, Ben died at 1 am at home Feb. 6, 1958.  Rieman's Funeral Home in Gulfport handled the burial.  Ben was buried in Evergreen Cemetery (block 10, lot 8) in Gulfport, MS.

Ophelia lived many years.  After she became infirm, she moved to the Plaza Nursing Home between Pascagoula and Moss Point.  She was there in 1971.  She shared a room there with her sister-in-law Vertie Lee Campbell, Ben's brother, Andrew's wife.

To celebrate her 90th birthday Ann Marie gave her a party at the nursing home.  Her family and friends gathered to honor this gentle lady.

Sadly, she died at 6:30 am June 14, 1979, and is buried beside Ben in Gulfport.  Granite headstones mark their graves.
