Born May 28, 1940, Elizabeth was the oldest child of Victor and Inez Havens Sims.  She was born at the Sims home at the end of Sims Mill Pond Rd. north of Vancleave, MS.

The Oddfellows and Rebekah Lodges sponsored trips to the United Nations in New York City.  Students competed by written exams and presenting a speech to the local lodge.  That was the first time my knees shook!  The Pascagoula lodge named three winners, John Allen Murphy, Nora Vowell and me.  In June 1957 traveling by bus, we spent one week going to New York; one week in the city; and one week returning by way of Canada.  It was an introduction to the outside world for a shy girl.
