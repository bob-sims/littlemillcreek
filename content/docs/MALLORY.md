James David Asbury "Jim" Hearn was born 4 Dec 1877, the son of Martha Jane Mixon Hearn and James Hearn, Sr.  His dad had lost the use of one arm in the battle of Shiloh in the Civil War.

Jim earned a degree in agriculture and served in the Spanish American War.  He married first Sue Graves.  She was ill when they married, and tragically, due to untreated diabetes, she died about six months later.  He then married Sue's sister Lyda Graves.  They had 5 boys:

1. Clement Hearn (b. 22 Feb 1901; d. 1-2 days later).
    2. Power Hearn (b. 10 June 1902; became president of Board of Supervisors of Hinds Co., MS).
3. Tom Hearn (b. 12 Apr 1904).
4. Jim Hearn (b. 20 Oct 1906).
5. David Hearn (b. 13 Feb 1908; in 1997 lives in Beaumont, TX).

Due to Jim's drinking, he and Lyda divorced.  Afterwards, she moved to Beaumont, TX.

On June 1, 1919, Vicey Nixon became Jim's third wife.  Born 2 April 1900, she was the daughter of Calvin and Aura Ophelia Nixon.  Wearing her best dress, she rode the train to Jackson to get married.   The ceremony was performed that night at the Noble Hotel in Jackson.  The next day they rode the train to Madison Station.  
They lived in a plantation home with white columns at Madison Station on the Pearl River in Madison Co., MS.  (Later this home was demolished to construct the Natchez Trace Parkway.)

Mallory was born 23 March 1920, in this home.  Named for her dad's friend, Mr. Jim Mallory, she was their oldest child.  Her dad had worked with Mr. Mallory on the railroad.

Later she had two younger sisters:

Elsie Hearn (b. 2 Dec 1921; d. 17 Feb 1938 in Moselle, MS of a botched abortion).
Martha Jane Hearn (b. 19 Nov 1923; md. William Lewis; no children; in 1997 live in Mobile, AL).

As a girl Mallory was thin.  Her Aunt Ethel would make her dresses.

After pets or small farm animals such as cats or ducks died, the children would conduct elaborate funerals.  Gene Nixon was the preacher.  Thomas Nixon was the undertaker.  (He actually became an undertaker as his adult profession.)  Mallory was the pall-bearer.  They gathered flowers from Aunt Alma's yard for the funerals.  She allowed them to pick cannas.  They also picked forbidden flowers: zinnas, impatiens, etc!

As a girl she took piano lessons from Dr. Carr's wife.  She also learned to play the guitar.

The family moved several times over the years.  They lived in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, in New Mexico and in Jackson, MS.   In Jackson, her dad operated the chicken farm at Fondren for the insane asylum.

Mallory graduated from Moselle High School in 1939.  Mr. Jim Mallory gave her a $100 bill as a special present.  She saved it and finally deposited it in the bank.  After graduating, Mallory enrolled at Jones Co. Junior College.  She took business courses.  She worked at the hosiery mill there to pay her expenses.

After the spring semester, she went to Lecompte, LA where her dad was managing a CC camp.  She searched for a house there for her mother and sister to move into, and hunted a job.  They found and rented a nice house.  She got a job at Brother Blackman's Laundry, where she worked up to an office job.  There she met Urshel Clark.

On the 30 June 1940, Mallory married Urshel Clark, a fair-complected man (b. 28 Sept 1914 at Lake Cove, LA).

They had two daughters:

1. Urshel Ann "Joann" Clark (b. 9 Mar 1943; md. Reece Vernon Seals; had 3 sons; divorced; in 1997 lives in Baker, LA.)
2. Mallory Sue Clark (b. 25 June 1945; md. Conrad Lewis "Pete" Juneau; had a daughter and a son; in 1997 live in Lafayette, LA.)

About 1955 Mallory and Urshel divorced.

Using her business training, Mallory worked in government offices.  
In Orange, TX on 23 June 1959, she married Tillman Highfill (b. 23 June 1932).  Jimmy Cox, Tillman's friend and neighbor, was best man at the wedding.  

Tillman had served in the army becoming a staff sergeant.  During the Korean War he worked as a translator for the Japanese.  

He operated tug-boats for offshore work.  Although she never learned to swim, Mallory was usually comfortable riding with Tillman on the tug-boat.  For years he worked for the Army Corp of Engineers.  He retired from that job.

After Port Arthur, TX, they lived in Galveston, TX, Sulfur, LA, Violet, LA, St. Bernard, LA, Gulfport, MS and Mobile, AL.  First they lived in mobile homes, then in government houses that the government would buy back from them.  They lived in New Orleans for 17 years.

Mallory went squirrel hunting with Tillman and his friends.  She killed an uncommon red squirrel.  They mounted it.

Her dad died 18 Dec 1960.  Her mother died 10 Dec 1974.  Both are buried at Crosby Cemetery in Moselle, MS.

Beginning in 1980, Mallory helped organize the annual Nixon Family reunion for the family.  Using beautiful script writing, she wrote invitations to all Nixon cousins.  It is held at various homes and community centers in either June or August each year.  The first year on August 3, it was at the old Nixon home site near Bobbie Earl Jones's home.  

About 1980 they moved to Baton Rouge, LA.  In 1987 and again in 1990 Mallory and Tillman hosted the Nixon reunion in their backyard on Greenwell St. in north Baton Rouge.  They had the place immaculate, not a stray leaf littered the ground.  They fried fish in the backyard.

Tillman and Mallory enjoyed traveling in their RV.  They joined travel groups.  Mallory loved to dance and participate in activities at campgrounds.

Sadly, Tillman, a cigarette smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer.  Unfortunately, he died 1 Sept. 1995.  He is buried at Greenoaks Memorial Cemetery in Baton Rouge.
