Born Dec 16, 1880, Edgar was the fifth child of Calvin Seymour and Elizabeth Mulholland Seymour.

As an adult he was about 5' 10" tall with black hair.  He weighed about 150lbs.  Edgar was a very likeable man.  Unfortunately, he drank.  

On Jan 30, 1901 he married Ida Quave, daughter of Peter Quave.  Father Moutier of Ocean Springs performed the ceremony at the Catholic Church on Back Bay.  After a reception at the home of the bride's parents, all went to the home of Capt. Young, the bride's godfather, for a dance.  Afterwards the couple departed on the night train for West Pascagoula where they made their first home.

They had the following children:

1) Eura Seymour (b. 1901; md. 1) Jim Krohn who drank; had 4 ? children; moved to CA; 2) _______ DiSibio; had 1 ? child).
2) Hazel Seymour (b. 1903; a beauty; md. ______ Flynn; had 1 child?).
3) Warren Seymour (b. 1906; moved to CA; md. Sylvie _____ in CA; no children).
4) Earl Seymour (b. 1909; md. Rose _______ in San Jose, CA).
5) Nona Seymour (b. 1915; Dec 8, 1934 md. Marshall E. Gollotte; raised her sister Ola's adopted child after Ola died.)	
6) & 7) Ola Seymour (b. 1917; had twin sister that died as an infant; lived in San Jose CA; died of cancer)
8) Glenn Seymour (b. 1920?; lived with Bill & Dora Havens several years; never married; served as sargent in US army; drank too much; d. 1963?.)

Edgar operated a general merchantile store, the North Side Grocery, in north Biloxi.  A frame structure about 30' x 50', it was situated at the north end of the old back bay bridge on the west side of the road.  It was a busy prosperous place.  The family worked in the store.

Edgar had a farm outside town on Ramsey Rd.  He kept a team of a horse and a mule there.  He grew corn with his team.  He butchered hogs and cows at his farm for sale at his store.

In 1910 Edgar & Ida with their 3 oldest children lived on a farm that they owned, according to the federal census of Apr. 2, 1910.  They lived next door to his brother Camille and his father, Calvin.  The two older children attended school within the year.

His niece Elsie Fletcher as a child remembers eating slender peanut butter stick candy at the store.

Drinking made him waste money.  Once in front of the store he flung $700 in bills up into the air and said, "Here, boys, come and get it! It's free."

He and his family lived in a nice house behind the store.

Ida died and is buried at the Quave Cemetery off Racetrack Rd.

In about 1926 (?) Edgar married Agnes Boney (b. Apr. 14, 1893 in North Biloxi).  She had a daughter Elmerita (b. 1917; md. Oliver Diaz) before they married.  Agnes was a very sweet woman, according to her niece's husband, Victor Sims.

Agnes and Edgar had only one child:

Edgar Frances Seymour (b. 1928?; md.      ; had several children; drank too much; in 1979 lived in Sunflower, MS; in 1995 lives at Ramsey Springs, MS).

He and Agnes would drive over north of Vancleave to visit Bill and Dora Havens, his sister and her family.

Edgar died Dec 15, 1943, at 1:30 pm of a heart attack.  He died the day before his 63rd birthday, the same day his father Calvin had died.
 
Father Patrick McAlpine conducted the funeral service at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church.  He is buried at Quave Cemetery.

Agnes lived at 117 Central Ave. in North Biloxi for many years.  

After two months hospitalization she died July 1, 1979 and is buried at the same cemetery.
