Born in January 1893, Chester was the son of Marion Francis "Frank" Moseley & Sousan Elizabeth "Lizzie" Sykes Moseley (d. 15 Feb 1958).  His parents were married in June 1888.  Frank is buried in Jones Co., MS about 9 miles south of Ellisville.

Chester grew up in a large family in Choctaw Co., AL.  His six sisters were named for steam boats that operated on the Tombigbee River!  He was the third child.  All his brothers married orphans.  His brothers & sisters were:

1. Emily Pearl Moseley (b. Apr. 1889; d. 1957; md. Jerry "Bud" Donald; had 6 children).
2. Francis Elmer Moseley (b. Feb 1891; md. Vinnie Covington (b. in Choctaw Co., AL); had 3 children).

As an adult Chester was a small man.   About 5'7" tall, he weighed about 125-130 lbs.  He smoked roll-your-own cigarettes.

He married Carrie Fleming.  Chester was fiesty, with a strong temper.  Carrie restrained him.  Over the years she became obese.

They had the following children:

1) Elmer Moseley (b. 11 Nov 1918; buried in Ore City, TX; md. Catherine Herrington).
2) Lorrene Moseley (b. 1920; became an R. N.; md. John P. Grafton). 
3) Cecil Moseley (b. 1923; md. Eunice Scruggs; in 1997 lives in Moselle, MS).
4) Nathan Earl Moseley (b. 1925; md. Mildred Roby; lives in Carterville, MS).
5 & 6) Set of twins born dead (1927?). 
7) Dorothy Helen Moseley (b. 21 Apr 1928; md. Lamar "Pedro" Williams).

Chester worked as a sharecropper.  He was a very hard worker.  He farmed with two mules, Ada and Rhoda.  They were 800 lb chestnut mules.  For his family, he and Carrie maintained fine, fat chickens, milk cows and a large fancy vegetable garden.

He grew cotton.  He would get up before daylight to poison the boll weevils in his cotton.  The powder would adhere to dew on the cotton leaves and bolls.  Beginning about 2 am he would ride one of the mules operating a hand-cranked mechanical spreader.  The poison was an arsenic compound and he wore a clean rag tied over his mouth and nose to prevent his inhaling the poison.

His hard work produced a good cotton crop.  He typically made 12 -14 bales of cotton.  That was 1/2 to a bale an acre, a good yield for those times.  One year he was paid in $20 gold pieces.  He received a handful!      

About 1926 he gave his cousin Victor Sims several game roosters.  They were standard size birds.  In a flock of chickens they protected the others from hawk attack.  They would fight the hawks.

About 1928 Carrie developed diabetes.  Thereafter Chester gave her at least one insulin shot every day for the rest of her life.

About 1932 Aunt M, a cousin, gave Chester $800.  He purchased a 120 acre farm near the old McDonald place, about 3 miles south of Moselle, MS in the Sellers community.  

Chester worked to improve this farm.  His son Nathan, a member of the FFA planted trees every year.  They planted pines and cedars.  They cared for cherry trees and mulberry trees.  They built arbors for scuppernongs and bullises.  The road to the farm in 1997 is named the Chester Moseley Road.

From feed sacks that had been dyed brown, Carrie made her dresses.  She wore these to pick cotton.

Sadly, during the Summer of 1956 Carrie died of diabetes.  At that time she weighed 350-400 lbs.  She was buried at the Mt. Zion Methodist Church cemetery about 3 miles SE of Waynesboro, MS.

In 1957 Chester married Lorrene Linley Moore, a widow with 3 children.  She went to the same church as Chester.  Over the next months he discovered that money and pigs were missing.  Lorrene and her youngest son, Howard, were taking them.  He divorced her.

In 1985 Chester lived in a retirement apartment in Ellisville with his third wife.  He enjoyed amazingly good health for his age. 

In 1986, sadly, he died.  He is buried at Mt. Zion Methodist Church beside Carrie.
