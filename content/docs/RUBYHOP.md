Ruby was born July 17, 1900, in Waynesboro, MS, the second daughter of Laura Sims Horton and John Horton.

As a girl she took piano lessons.  She enjoyed playing popular songs such as "Under the Double Eagle".

Her cousin Victor Sims described her as a calm, mild-mannered girl.  She matured early and helped her mother with housework.

As a young woman she had several jobs.  She first worked at Al's Drug Store in Hattiesburg.  Later she worked for a drug store in Gulfport and lived with her Aunt Cookie Sims Norwood there.  

December 21, 1919, in Hattiesburg she married Jacob Ester Pruitt (b. Apr. 26, 1896 in Winchester, Tenn.).  He worked as a lineman for the Southern Railroad.  Ruby met him when he stayed at the hotel her mother operated in Purvis (on the Southern line).

They had the following children (all born in Columbus, MS):

1) Mary Frances Pruitt (b. May 31, 1921; d. September 26, 1995; md. 1)         2) Nov 4, 1950 James Ralph Wood (b. Mar 29, 1918 in St. Johnsville, NY; d. June 12, 1987, in Ocean Springs, MS)).

Ruby loved yard work.  Growing flowers gave her pleasure.

Ester worked for a nursery in Columbus, MS.  

Later he worked at Vicksburg Power & Light Co. as an electrician.  Ruby worked as the housekeeper at the O'Conner Hotel there.

About 1942 they moved to Mobile he worked as an electrician at the shipyard.  Then he worked at Victory Electric Co. there.  They lived at 107 N. Catherine St.

Ester enjoyed squirrel hunting.  Every winter he made a trip to northern Jackson Co., MS to visit the Sims and go hunting in the Pascagoula River swamp.  He had a nice 20 gauge pump shotgun.  Most squirrels there are grey squirrels; rarely a big red squirrel is killed. 

Victory Electric did contract work for Hollingsworth Whitney paper mill.  On July 9, 1951, while on a lunch break there he collapsed and died of a heart attack.

About 1953 she moved to 114 Garnett Ave.  She remained there in good health until 1987 when she had a stroke.  Esther Mae and Gene Elliot moved her to their home in Mobile.  Mary Frances stayed with them to help nurse their mother.

During these last years Ruby maintained very good spirits.  She enjoyed visits from cousins.

She died in 1992 and is buried at Pine Crest Cemetery in Mobile.
