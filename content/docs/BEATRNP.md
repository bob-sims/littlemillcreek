Born November 10, 1903, Beatrice Helen was the first child of Zadie and Cookie Norwood.   

Bea was named for her aunt, her mother's older sister Clara Beatrice Sims Green.  Tragically her aunt died of tb in Augusta, GA in 1901.  Her aunt's infant son, Edward Green, died that same year.

She had an older half brother Robert Norwood (b. about 1896).  Later she would have younger brothers: Phillip (b. 1905) and twins, Max and Joe (b. 1908).

The 1920 federal census lists her at 16, Phillip was 14, and Max and Joe, were 11.  They lived in a mortgaged house and Zadie worked as a night watchman.  Phillip was out of school working to help support the family.

At about this time Cookie taught her shorthand from a stenographer's book.  She began to work as a secretary.

For a while Bea worked for the Mississippi Power Co.  They employed her first in Hattiesburg and later in Gulfport.  They provided company stock as a part of employee pay.  She accumulated some stock.

Bea married Lawrence Manning Power Sunday, July 31, 1927 in Gulfport.  Rev. C. S. Newman, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony.  

Lawrence was born May 20, 1888, in Georgia.  He operated a medical supply company that serviced drug stores over a large territory: LA, MS, AL and GA.  

They lived at the Great Southern Hotel on the beach in Gulfport.
Cookie stayed with them.

In 1934 they had a son Lawrence Power Jr.  He was a slender, small child.

Tragically June 15, 1939 her husband died.  He suffered a fatal heart attack at the hotel where they lived.  He was buried in Roswell, Georgia.

Bea resumed work.  She was employed for several years as a secretary with the Department of Agriculture in Gulfport.

About 1942 she worked for that same department in Washington, D. C.  They lived there about a year.  Larry, age 8, was impressed by the snow.

She transferred to Los Angeles, CA continuing with the same work.

In 1954 she moved to El Paso, TX to work for El Paso Natural Gas Co.  Her brother Max Norwood was Controller there.

In 1964 she moved to Twenty-nine Palms, CA. to be near her son.  Larry was head librarian there.  She remained there for the rest of her life.

She lived independently until about a year before her death when declining health forced her to move into the home of her son Larry, his wife, Miriam and their infant child, Henry David Power.  She was surely proud of the baby.  (Later they had a second son, Francis Joseph).

Sadly, she died of a heart attack on April 5, 1994.  She was cremated and her ashes spread over the Pacific Ocean as she wished.
