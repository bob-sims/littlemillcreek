Born August 22, 1886, Solie was the fourth son and eighth child of Robert and Elizabeth Campbell Sims.  The youngest child, he was born in Choctaw Co. in SW Alabama.  Later he remarked that his mother's first words when she saw him were, "Somebody slipped a naked monkey in my bed!"

After his father's and older brother Bailey's tragic deaths, the family moved to eastern Mississippi.  He attended school first in Waynesboro at the Redbud School and then in Stonewall, MS.

As a young man he had a gray horse named Spot.  Once when fox hunting and drinking he had a narrow escape.  About 4 am one morning he became alert atop the bluff overlooking Tallehallie Creek.  On horseback he had been urging old Spot to jump off the bluff!  He said, "Quite early on I learned that I didn't have enough sense to drink whiskey."

Solie usually kept three or four dogs.  He would cook corn meal mush outside for dog food. 

Old Pup, about a 40 lb. white bulldog with one black eye, was his champion squirrel dog.  Old Pup chose Solie.  Mr. Jim Turner from Ellisville drove cattle by the house one day and a tired white dog stayed behind.  Solie wrote to Mr. Turner explaining that he had his dog.  He came and retrived him.  However about a week later Pup reappeared dragging a block attached by a chain to his collar.  He had pulled this load 12-14 miles to return.  Again Solie wrote, but this time Mr. Turner never came.  Solie trained him until he became an expert treer.  He would kill squirrels and rabbits by cracking their skulls.

In 1917 during World War I Solie was drafted into the army.  He completed basic training at Camp Shelby in Forrest Co., MS in a unit with some of his friends.  Israel Shimper, son of Sam Shimper, was in the same infantry unit.  

As the Fall approached, Solie went to his commanding officer and requested a 30-day leave.  He asked permission to go home to harvest the crop for his mother and sister, Ruby.  The permission was granted.  (They grew 4-5 bales of cotton a year.)  While at home he requested a 30-day extension to complete the work.  It was granted.  During this leave his unit shipped out without him to the battlefields of France.  Back at Camp Shelby he was assigned to care for horses in the remount unit.  After about 10 months service when the war ended, he was discharged.  Thereafter he told stories of his experiences in France!

His sister, Cookie's sons Max and Joe trapped a mink and prepared and sold its pelt.  With the $9 they earned they bought Solie a new straight razor.

Hereafter Solie continued to share a house with his mother and his sister, Ruby.  As the baby of the family, he was somewhat spoiled.  This was an unusually harmonious family.  To tease his mother he would scoop her up in his arms and dance around the room carrying her.  To scold him his mother would call him a 'scalawag'.  His brother, Iggie would bring his fiddle and play for them.  His mother's favorite tune was "Bonaparte's Retreat". 

Solie smoked roll-your-own cigarettes.  Prince Albert tobacco was shaken from a can onto an OCB paper.  The cigarette was rolled and licked to seal the edge of the paper.  He never seemed to suffer any ill effects from smoking. 

Beginning about 1919 he worked for the Southern Railroad.  At first he worked on a section crew.  The six men in each crew rode hand cars (that were later motorized) to search for problems on the track.  They found rotten, split or weathered ties and replaced them.  Often there was not enough slag (produced by steel mills) under the ties to support them.  The men raked slag from the sides to elevate the roadbed.  A fine, solid roadbed packs 30" of slag beneath the rails.  This hard work developed his muscles.

Later he worked for about six months as fireman for the Southern Railroad.  The fireman shoveled coal into the firebox.  Using a square-ended shovel with a short, loop handle as he swung the coal he tapped a foot peddle.  The peddle activated a steam cylinder that opened the 15" x 15" double doors of the furnace.  Immediately after the coal was slung into the fire the doors shut to contain the heat.  The trip from New Orleans to Meridian burned 8 tons of coal.  

This steam engine pulled 35 to 40 freight cars.  The crew included a flagman, a brakeman, a conductor, an engineer and the fireman.  They hauled livestock in cattlecars; oil in tank cars; bananas in refrigerated cars (cooled with ice); lumber and general cargo, trailed by a caboose.  

One day he announced to the family, "Today I learned when old Spot was born.  He was born under the big oak in front of Uncle Jimmy McDonald's old place the day Harry K. Thaw killed Stanford White!" (White, a prominent architect, was shot in New York City in a widely publicized crime June 25, 1906.)

In 1929 his mother, with whom he lived, suffered a severe stroke.  Sadly, in several days this gentle lady died.

That same year Abe House, a hard-working Black man, retired from Waldo's, Solie's brother's, cotton gin.  Spot was given to Uncle Abe.  About a year later Spot was loaned to Uncle Abe's neighbor who did not feed him.  Years later, when Solie learned that Spot had starved to death, his eyes filled with tears.

Beginning about 1930 he got a veteran's pension.  Miles Porter, the former postman in Moselle and a country lawyer, helped him with the paperwork to get the pension.  Initially, he received $10 a month.

In 1932 he was living at his mother's old home NE of Estabutchie.  Later he moved to his sister Ruby's house in Estabutchie.

About 1943 Victor Sims, his nephew, got him a job at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula.  He worked as a striker in the blacksmith shop under Mr. McFall.  The striker swung the hammer.  In sharpening chisels on an emery wheel specks of metal or carborundum got in his eyes.  His eyes became infected and he went to a doctor in Mobile.  After his eyes healed, he worked at the surplus warehouse in the shipyard.  This was not really work at all.  He counted items for inventory-sometimes!  During his two to three years at Ingalls, he lived with relatives and paid into Social Security.

While he worked there Mr. McKenzie, the superintendent of the fab shop found a stack of his unclaimed pay checks.  He called Solie in to ask about it.  Solie claimed that he wanted to contribute to the war effort and he assumed that when the war was over they would settle up!

Because Solie never learned to drive or owned a car, he was a frequent bus rider.  He became friends with several of the Greyhound drivers on the routes from Laurel to Pascagoula and Mobile.  He entertained them with his stories.  He transported amazing cargo on these busses.  Once he carried a four-eyed wood-burning stove; on another trip he carried barbed wire and steel posts to fence five acres of land!

Sadly, in June 1959, his sister Ruby, with whom he lived, died.  Although Solie could make biscuits and cook a little, he didn't.  With no one to cook for him, thereafter he ate food from Mrs. Meador's small store.    

Improbable as it is, Solie was struck by lightening twice in his life.  On both occasions he was hit in his yard in Estabutchie.  The second time in about 1962, he was sleeping in a hammock.  A sudden storm developed and lightening struck the tree holding the hammock.  The lightening bolt knocked him out and burned him.  Metal objects, his pocket knife, his Prince Albert tobacco can in his hip pocket, and his belt buckle, produced the worst burns.  The rainfall revived him.  He sustained no permanent injury.  

His house was never wired for electricity.  Light was provided by coal oil (kerosene) lamps.  He heated the house with fires in the fireplace started by pouring coal oil on the wood.  

From about 1968 until 1972 a Sims reunion was held at his house in Estabutchie every August.  Each family brought food and folding chairs.  From 25 to 40 people enjoyed this gathering under the trees in his yard.  Many photographs remain of these picnics.

In about 1972 as he was watching clearing done with heavy equipment at the cemetery, he was struck by a flying chunk of wood.  The cut on his upper leg required stitches.  He was flown to the VA Hospital in Biloxi for care.  He had been at the cemetery to insure that no damage was done to the family graves.

In 1975 Rose Brunson called his niece, Grace, saying that Solie was not himself.  After taking his dog to a friend's house, Grace drove him to the VA Hospital in Biloxi.  He had had small strokes that affected his behavior.  In December Grace brought Solie to her home in Gautier for Christmas.  At that time he was unable to walk.

On August 15, 1976, while Ruby Pruitt and her daughter Ester Mae Elliot were visiting him at the VA hospital, as he was having supper, he simply stopped breathing.  It was one week before his 90th birthday. 

Rev. Norsworthy conducted the funeral service.  Solie is buried with his mother, sister, Ruby, and brother, Iggie in the cemetery in Estabutchie.  Victor bought a tombstone and set it in place.  On the front it is inscribed: " Wit, Sage & Philosopher; Was Never the Brunt of Another Man's Joke and Was Envied by All".  On the back it carries an old English epitaph recited by Solie,

"Pause blooming youths as you pass by,
And on these lines do cast an eye.
As you are now so once was I.
As I am now soon you will be.
Prepare for death and follow me."
