Max was born in Collins, MS, October 1908, the son of Zadie and Cookie Norwood.  A fraternal twin, he was born minutes before his brother Joe.  He had an older half-brother Robert Norwood (b. about 1896), an older sister, Beatrice (b. 1903), and an older brother Phillip (b. 1905).

Max had blond hair, a long aquiline nose and large ears.  His twin Joe, named for Joe Campbell, his mother's uncle, had dark hair.

His mother Cookie developed severe tuberculosis after the birth of the twins.  She was weakened by the disease, especially the coughing. 

Although Zadie Norwood was a carpenter, he was a poor provider.  When work was plentiful during World War I, he didn't have a steady job.  He tried to work as a policeman or to assist a deputy sheriff.  In 1920 the census records that he was a night watchman.  He refused to let the boys play ball; he refused to let them go fishing or hunting.  Robert tried to make excuses for his dad.

About 1914 the family moved to a rented house in Hattiesburg.  It was a nice house with high ceilings at 141 West 5th St.  They kept a red cow staked out behind the house.  All the boys could milk.  They had an outdoor toilet in the backyard.

Because Max was a puny child, he stayed with his grandmother Elizabeth Campbell Sims and his aunt Ruby Sims Jordan in Estabutchie.  This reduced his risk of contracting tb from his mother.  They gave him school lessons and encouraged him in his studies.  Later he went to school in Estabutchie.

About 1922 Cookie's tb stabilized.

About 1925, the family moved to Gulfport because the older children had jobs there.

Max graduated in 1927 from Forest County Agricultural High School.  Previously, he had lived with his Uncle Waldo and Aunt Idell and gone to school one year in Seminary.

He attended and graduated from Soule Business College in New Orleans.  Colonel George Soule founded the college in 1856.  When Max attended, it occupied a handsome building, the former Eustis Mansion, at 1410 Jackson Ave. in the Garden District.

He also attended Loyola University there.  He was careful with money.

In 1932 his first job in New Orleans was as a cashier.  In 1933 he worked as purchasing agent for Betty Lou Bakeries Co.  In 1935 he kept business books.  Beginning in 1938 for the next 10 years (with one exception) he worked for Wm. B. Jones & Co.  He served as accountant and auditor.

Joe related the following incident.  Max was keeping the books for a small laundry in New Orleans that was going broke.  With no one else to intervene to save the business, Max did.  He announced to the employees that if they wanted to work, that was the place to stay.  If not, they were not needed.  He then fired about half the employees.  After the laundry began making money, Max obtained insurance for it.  Then the folks that owned it, took over.  That was the beginning of his prosperity.

Max visited his Sims cousins in rural Jackson Co, MS, north of Vancleave.  On one weekend trip he brought a rod and reel and flies for fly fishing.  Victor took him out in Black Creek in a skiff.  While he was fishing he gave Victor tips on fly fishing.  Then he loaned him the rod & reel for him to try it.  They caught a nice string of brim (large mouthed perch).  Max gave Victor the fly fishing equipment before he returned to New Orleans on Sunday.

About 1936 Max married Celina A.      , a German Catholic girl from New Orleans.  They lived at 4630 Music St. in New Orleans.  They visited Waldo Sims and his family in northern Jackson Co.

In 1944 Max and Celine had a daughter, Cecilia Anne.

From 1945-46 Max worked for the government as an accountant in the civil service.  Specifically he was employed as assistant reg. auditor by the U. S. Maritime Commission.  He examined the books of companies to find fraud where companies tried to cheat the government.  One of the targets of his probe was the El Paso Natural Gas Co.  They so respected his skills that they made him a job offer.

After the war about 1947, he contacted them and they hired him.  Thereafter he lived with his family in El Paso, TX.

He prospered with El Paso Natural Gas.  January 1, 1948 he was promoted to Controller at El Paso Natural Gas.  In 1961 he was named Vice President of the company.

In 1954 Max helped his sister Beatrice Power get a secretarial job at his company.  She moved to El Paso and lived there the next 10 years.

In 1961 when his cousin Hugo Sims stopped for a visit on a trip west, the family had just moved into a fine new home.

Cecilia graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School May 25, 1964.

When a mole was removed from his cheek, it left a scar.  When another doctor worked to remove the scar, a cancer developed.  This tragedy killed him on July 1, 1965.  He is buried at El Paso.

Their daughter, Cecilia, married Edwin Kops Wisbrun, a businessman, on January 21, 1968 at Lancer's Hall in El Paso.   He manages "Jack in the Box" restaurants.  They have two daughters: Laura (b. Mar 24, 1970) and Wendy (b. Apr 19, 1975).  It's unfortunate that Max didn't live to enjoy his granddaughters.
