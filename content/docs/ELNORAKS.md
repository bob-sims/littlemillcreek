Elnora was born August 5, 1920, the third of eight children of John Wesley (b. Feb 18, 1886) and Thelma Ester Hazel Knapp King (b. Jan 25, 1895).  A midwife, Elizabeth Parker delivered all the King children.  She was born at the King home, her grandfather's home, in George Co., MS at Tiger Branch in the same room as her father.

Her brothers and sisters included: 

1) Dove Elmire "D. E." King (b. Nov 19, 1914; md. 1) Edna Earle _____; 2) Fannie Mae _____). 
2) Sara Leona King (b. Oct 17, 1916; md. "Lum" Jordan). 
3) John Wesley King (b. Nov 12, 1922?; d. aged 2 months). 
4) Mary Frances King (b. Jan 25, 1924; md. Clyde Reid). 
5) Arelous George King (b. Jan 13, 1926; md. 1) Minnie Lee _____; 2) Marianne _____; d.    ; buried in Houston, TX VA cemetery). 
6) Oscar Sevelle King (b. Oct 22, 1928; md. "Nita" _____). 
7) Nelda Deverne King (b. Sept 19, 1932; md. James Childs).

She attended school at Benndale Grammer School.  The children rode in a converted truck.  Her Dad had built a body on the truck with a wooden floor, a roof and benches along the sides.  In bad weather canvases were rolled down on the sides.  Her Dad drove the bus about 7 miles to the school.

Her mother had a peddle Singer sewing machine.  Elnora made her first dress during the Christmas holiday when she was 13.  Made from yellow cloth with tiny black and white plaid, it had a three gored skirt and short sleeves.

She attended the first two years of high school at Basin High in George Co.  To graduate she transferred to the Deep Creek School in Perry Co.  She lived with the Walter O'Neal family there for about 6 months.  Her family had moved to Agricola.  She graduated from the Deep Creek School in 1939. 

In 1935 while in school at Basin she contracted serious blood poisoning.  It originated from scratching a blemish near the corner of her mouth.  She developed fever and prolonged pain from the site.  Her face swelled so much that her right eye was closed.  Dr. Spiceland applied ichthyol ointment, a black salve, over the site and painted half her face with iodine as a disinfectant.  Her mother slept with her four nights to comfort her.  Gradually she recovered.

In high school she met Denby Doyle Breland, son of Lo Ernie Breland (b. 23 Aug 1888?) and Thania Breland (b. 25 July 1886).  After her graduation she married Denby on April 16, 1939.  They were married in Wiggins by a Justice of the Peace.

The young couple lived with Denby's parents.  Mr. Breland, a building contractor, was away much of the time.  Denby farmed there at his parents home until 1947.  Elnora later made an oil painting of this home.

Their son, Elton Doyle Breland, was born January 21, 1940.  Elnora went to her parent's home, the King home, in Agricola to have her baby.  Dr. Spiceland delivered the boy.

On February 7, 1947, Mr. Breland was killed in a car accident.  On a foggy night as he was returning home from Mobile his car collided with a train stopped across the roadway.  Elnora wrote a poem about this tragedy.  He was buried in Perry Co., but later Mrs. Breland had his body moved to the cemetery in Lucedale.  

Elnora, Denby and their son lived for about a year in his aunt Kate Breland's house in Perry Co.

In 1945 Mr. Breland bought the Morgan Hotel in Lucedale for about $12,000.  He purchased it from Mrs. Morgan after her husband had died.  They changed its name to the Lucedale Hotel.  They operated this hotel from February 1947 to May 1956.  

The Lucedale Hotel was a two floor brick building.  About 15 rooms, a few with a private bath, filled the second floor.  They charged about $3.50 per night to rent a room, and about half the rooms were usually rented.  Mrs. Nellie Howell, a widow, worked as the maid in the hotel.  The cleaners did the hotel's laundry.  The lower floor was a cafe.

The cafe had a counter with stools along one wall and cloth-covered tables with chairs.  The cafe included a juke box, nickel slot machines and a pool hall with 4 or 5 pool tables.  Fred Thomlin owned the slot machines and the hotel got a percentage of their profit.

Groceries were delivered by Merchants Grocery and tobacco by the Corso Tobacco Co. from Hattiesburg.  The cafe was open 24 hours a day for the first several years.  Thereafter it opened at 4 am and closed at 11 pm.  As she had on the farm, Elnora worked hard in the cafe.  She made 10 to 12 pies each morning.  She worked long hours.  The cafe sold many sandwiches and hamburger steaks.

About 1951 Mrs. Breland suffered a heart attack.  She was hospitalized for a month at Providence Hospital in Mobile.  Thereafter to avoid stairs for her the family lived in an apartment owned by Pierce Bailey.  Then after renovating the first floor of the hotel to include living quarters, they returned to the hotel.

George Co. at the time was a dry county.  Evenso they had rough fights in the cafe when drunks returned from drinking trips.  About 2 am one morning a drunk socked Mr. Breland and broke his jaw.  He grabbed his pistol from a closet and fired at their fleeing car.  They sold the hotel for $25,000 to the Walker 5 and 10 cent store.

In 1956 when the family moved to Hattiesburg, Mrs. Breland was poorly, Denby had angina and Elnora had her first gall bladder attack.  They rented a house on Hardy St. near the Baptist Church.

Elnora worked fulltime at Clara's Beauty Shop uptown on Hardy St.  She enrolled in a class at USM in 1957.  

On September 2 as a friend Ora Lee Montague from Petal was about to drop her off in front of their house a car rear-ended their car.  It hurled the car 70 ft. across the walk and into a neighbor's yard.  Although Elnora sustained severe whip lash, x-rays showed no damage.  The next day while doing a manicure, she had a delayed reaction, became limp and collapsed.  The principal injury was to her neck.  She wore a stiff neck collar for the next four months (except to sleep).

Denby was not drafted due to the condition of his heart.  This may have resulted from childhood scarlet fever.  Unfortunately, he was a chain smoker.  He took nitroglycerine tablets for his angina.  Both a doctor in Hattiesburg and Dr. Heniger, a heart specialist, in Gulfport couldn't find anything wrong with his heart.  In December 1957 he developed asian flu.  While sick with the flu, he suffered a heart attack.  Sadly, he died December 26, 1957.  He was buried in Lucedale with his Dad.

In 1958 Elnora's gall bladder required surgery.  Dr. Connerly assisted by Dr. Tatum removed her gall bladder with 23 gall stones. The ether anesthetic made her sick, especially nauseous, for three days.  She was hospitalized for 8 days.  Methodist Hospital charged about $600. 

In the Summer of 1958 Mrs. Breland bought an apartment house uptown.  They lived downstairs and rented the apartments upstairs.  Elton graduated from Hattiesburg High in 1958.

Over the years Elnora had used Mrs. Breland's sewing machine.  She had made all Elton's clothes while he was young and her own clothes (except their underwear).  In 1958 she bought a Singer zig-zag machine.  This was the second year for these machines.  Denby's cousin, Audry Lee Breland, was the salesperson who sold her the machine.

Early in 1960 they moved to a nice house on 110th Ave.  In February of that year Elnora opened her own beauty shop.  The Beauty Lounge on Hardy St. had 5 stations.  Beauticians worked on 50% commission.  Unfortunately, there were not enough customers to make the business profitable.  

On February 19, 1961 she married Victor H. Sims of Pascagoula at her home in Hattiesburg.  She wore a blue crepe dress and carried a bouquet of flowers.  Rev. C. S. Molder performed the ceremony.  Elnora's sister, Nelda Childs and Victor's son, Hugo Sims, served as attendants.  About 35 friends and relatives attended.  Walter Green's florist provided the flowers.

As the beauty shop was open six days a week, Elnora became a commuter.  After work on Saturday she drove to Pascagoula.  She returned to Hattiesburg Sunday nights.

Mrs. Breland became more and more infirm.  Sadly, she died at home on July 10, 1961 of pancreatic cancer.  Mrs. Myers, a woman who helped care for her, a nurse who had come to give a pain shot and Verlie Green, her daughter, were there with Elnora when she died.  A friend had told Elnora that her mother had been pain-free for three days before she died of cancer.  Thus when Mrs. Breland became pain-free, Elnora called Verlie, so that she was there.  She was buried in Lucedale.

When the three year lease for the beauty shop expired, Elnora did not renew it.  A woman who had committed to buy it, reneged.  She obtained a lease on her own.  The equipment was reclaimed by the company.  She moved to Pascagoula.

Elnora began bowling in Lucedale for fun.  In 1957 in Hattiesburg she bowled in a league every week.  She continued bowling in Pascagoula and Gautier.  She became a fine bowler accumulating many trophies.  She achieved a 165 pin average.  In May 1993 she injured her knee in a tournament in Gulfport.  Subsequently, she has not bowled.

In 1985 Elnora first took oil painting lessons.  Later she began to work with Audice Shelton in Gautier.  She won a number of blue ribbons at the Jackson Co. Fair for landscapes and still lifes.

She joined the Eastern Star about October 1965.  She sings in the choir and participates in services at the First Baptist Church in Pascagoula.
