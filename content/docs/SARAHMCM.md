Sarah was born in 1835 in Bladen Co., NC, the oldest child of William Sims (b. 1805) and Susan Hester Sims (b. 1812).  She was named for her father's mother, Sarah Sims.

In 1845 when she was 10, the family moved to Choctaw Co., AL.

Sadly, about 1851 her father died.  About 1852 her mother married Lamuel (or Lemuel) McMichael (b.in GA).  His wife had died, and like Susan, he had children.

About 1856 she married William McMichael (b. 1830 in GA), the son of Lamuel McMichael.  

They had the following known children:

Lamuel McMichael (b. 1857; in 1903 applied to homestead 153 acres of land in Wayne Co., MS).
Harriet Amanda McMichael (b. 1859; Dec 29, 1880 md. James R. Maiden (b. Apr 1861)).  They continued to own and operate their farm in Choctaw Co. in 1920.  They had the following known children:
a) William E. Maiden (b. Mar 1882; md. Lillian Campbell (b. Apr 30, 1885; d. Aug 28, 1907); William was a widower in 1910).
b) Martha E. Maiden (b. Mar 1885).
c) Cora L. Maiden (b. July 1889).
d) Abbie L. Maiden (b. Sept 1893).
e) James T. Maiden (b. Sept 1896).
Thomas J. McMichael (b. Aug 1877; md. Gladys _____).

On January 12, 1860, William bought land in township 11 range 2 west.  This transaction was recorded in book 77 at St. Stephens land office.  His wife's cousin, Sarah Sims Foster, bought land nearby the same day.

The 1860 census, recorded 3 Sept. 1860, listed the family with real estate valued at $1000 and a personal estate valued at $552.  They lived next door to Lamuel and Susan McMichael.  

William served as a private in Co. F of the 32nd Reg't. AL infantry in the Civil War.  He enlisted Feb 20, 1863 in Choctaw Co. serving under Capt. Fry.  On Apr 15, 1863 he was paid $50 in Tullahoma, Tennessee, by Capt. J. A. Montgomery.  He was reported absent August 28, but returned Oct 20, 1863. (Commonly, men returned home to harvest their crop and provide for their families.)  William was sent to the hospital by the regimental surgeon Feb 24, 1864, for unspecified illness.  

On August 4, 1864, he was captured near Atlanta, GA by forces under Maj. Gen. W. T. Sherman.  He was transferred via military prison in Louisville, KY to be held at Camp Chase, Ohio on August 13, 1864.  He remained there until he was paroled March 18, 1865, and moved to Ft. Lookout, Maryland for exchange.

Regrettably, about 1885 Sarah died.

On Jan 1, 1890 William married Mrs. Sarah A. Maiden.  In 1870 a Sallie Maiden (b. 1851) appeared in the census as the wife of a William Maiden in Sumter Co., AL.  This might have been the woman who later married William McMichael.  Her relationship to the James R. Maiden who married Amanda McMichael is unknown.

Sadly, William died Oct 28, 1894.  In the probate records S. A. McMichael was given as his widow.  Thomas J. McMichael, a minor child, was named in the records.  The value of William's real and personal estate was less than $2000.

In both 1900 and 1910 Thomas J., according to the federal censuses, lived with his sister Amanda and her husband James Maiden in Choctaw Co.  He is not in their household in 1920.
