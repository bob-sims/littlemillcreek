Sarah was born in 1822 in North Carolina the daughter of Benjamin and Narcissa Sims.

About 1825 the family moved to southwest Alabama.  

On June 1, 1842 in Washington Co., AL Sarah married Drury Foster (b. 1816).  Rev. E. Pitty performed the ceremony.

Drury was possibly the son of Priscilla Foster.  After she was widowed she married Elisha Tyler in AL in 1821.  Drury voted in Sumter Co., AL at Gaston Leat Wideman Mill on March 4, 1837.

Drury was a shoemaker.  Because Sarah was listed as the head of the household in the census of 1860 and he was listed after the children, I assume that he was disabled.

Sarah and Drury had the following known children:

Cordelia W. Foster (b. 1844)
Benjamin S. Foster (b. 1846; about 1876 married Josephine ___; known children: Melvin (b. 1877) & Louis (b. 1879); in 1880 family lives in Falls Co. TX.)
Ann M. Foster (b. 1854; about 1880 md. J. C. Tabor (b. 1857 in AL); in 1880 the Tabors lived with brother Ben & family in Falls Co., TX).

On January 12, 1860 Sarah bought land in township 11, range 3 west.  This transaction was recorded in book 77 at St. Stephens land office.  Her cousin, Sarah Sims McMichael's husband, William McMichael bought land nearby the same day.

The 1860 census taken Sept 3, 1860 listed the family as residents of Choctaw Co, AL.  They had real estate valued at $400 and a personal estate valued at $130.  They lived next door to Robert & Susan Sims and their family.  Robert was Sarah's brother.  Their mother, "Narcis" Sims, lived with Robert and his family.   

Before the Civil War, according to family legend, the family moved to Texas.
