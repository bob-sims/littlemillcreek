The Robert Sims that resided in Bladen Co., NC in 1800 was possibly born about 1745.

On Nov 12, 1766 a Robert Sims purchased 100 acres of land on Raft Swamp.  Later this would be included in Robeson Co. and Hoke Co.

In Feb 1772 Robert witnessed a deed.  On July 25, 1774, Robert Sims received 640 acres of land in Bladen Co. on the drains of Plummer's creek patented from the crown.  On Aug 10, 1774, he bought 300 acres west of Little Marsh from James Moore.
  
Robert and Elizabeth Lowe lived together their entire lives and raised a family, but never married.  They had the following known children:

Susannah (b. 1772??)
Mary (b. 1774?; could not read or write; md. James Bryan (b. 1765?; d. 1845?); had at least 3 sons and 1 daughter; owned slaves in 1840.).	
Sarah (b. 1775??; d. 1844?).
William (b. 1778??; d. 1817??; md. ____ _____ ; had 6 children).
Dorothy "Dolly" (b. 1782??; between Nov 30, 1805 and Aug 29, 1807 md. Archibald McFatter (b. 1775?; d. 1835?); had at least 1 son and 7 daughters; owned slaves in 1830).  
Benjamin (b. 1783?, d. 1855?; 1815? md. Narcissa _____ (b. 1893; d. 1875?); had at least one son and 3 daughters.)

Robert was described as a planter.  He commonly bought and sold lands.  Eventhough the Bladen Co. courthouse burned twice (in 1800 and 1893), land records remain from 1734, the year the county was created!  Many of Robert's transactions are documented in these records.

In 1784 Robert owned 2031 acres of taxable land in Bladen Co.

In August 1787, the sheriff of Bladen County, Wm. McRee, sold 400 acres of Robert's land with all improvements including his home at public auction.  Alex Graham paid 7 pounds, 6 shillings as the highest bidder.  This was to pay debts owed by Robert to Bladen County Court for suits that he had brought against Thomas White, James Jackson, and Live (?) Glass.

In 1788 Robert was listed as owning 720 acres of taxable property in Bladen Co..  He owns no town lots.  One free poll is listed.

In 1790 Robert Sims was recorded in the first U. S. Census in Robeson Co. in southeastern North Carolina.  In addition to two adults, the household included 2 sons, 1 over 16 and 1 under 16; 4 daughters and no slaves.

On July 2, 1792 the sheriff, Joseph Wood, sold 80 acres of land owned by Robert at public auction to Jacob Rhodes.  This was to recover 16 shillings in court costs owed by Robert to the Robeson County Court.   (In these revolutionary times it's possible that the sheriffs were hard on Robert because he was a loyalist, a supporter of the English crown.  We don't know.)

In 1800 Robert and Elizabeth and their family lived in Bladen County in SE North Carolina.  Robert and Elizabeth were over 45; one son (Benjamin?) was under 16 and one daughter (Dolly?) was between 16 and 26.  No slaves were present.

Robert died about 1806 in Bladen County.  He signed deeds turning his land over to his children on Nov. 30, 1805.  The deed stated that this was "for 100 pounds current money and for them to maintain and support him during his natural life" (vol.27, p. 319).  In a land transaction on August 29, 1807, he is described as "the late Robert Sims."

Elizabeth in 1810 was living with her son Benjamin Sims in Bladen Co.  She possibly died about 1815, as she is absent from the 1820 census.
