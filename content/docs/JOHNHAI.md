In a will probated Dec 1764, in Frederick Co., VA, William Hall listed among his legatees his daughter Ruth Havin.  John Heavin (sic) served as one of 3 witnesses to this will.  Ruth's mother was ___ Richardson Hall.  This could have been our John Havens I.

On 8 Apr 1773, John signed an indenture with Thomas Lord Fairfax of Frederick Co., VA Colony.  Cyril Cain designated this man as John Havens I.  However in Frederick County court records from 1765-67 a judge states, "Upon the petition of John Havins an ancient and infirm man he is discharged from paying county levys."  This elderly man was probably an even earlier John Havens.

In the 1773 lease John agreed to pay rent to operate a farm.  The farm, measured in poles, contained 100 acres.  The lease excluded minerals but allowed stone needed on the farm to be removed from a stone quarry.  John agreed to plant at least 100 good apple trees 30 feet from each other.  He was to keep them pruned and within a good fence.  He agreed to cause to be built a dwelling house 20 feet long and 16 feet wide within 3 years from Apr. 1773.  A penalty of 5 pounds was to be charged if the yearly rent was not paid within 90 days of the due date.

Two of John's older sons, John II and Joel were named in the lease.

In 1782 John was listed in the VA state census.  The 8 whites in his household possibly included him, his wife and 6 children.  His son John II lived next door with his family.

The 1787 personal property tax for Frederick Co. listed John Sr. with 3 horses and 6 cows.  He and his son John II appeared side by side on the list.

Unfortunately, the 1790 federal census of VA was destroyed.

About 1795 John died.  At about that time John II and his family moved to Mobile, AL.  They would not have moved leaving an elderly parent behind.
