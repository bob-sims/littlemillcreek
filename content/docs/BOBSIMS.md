Bob Sims was born 2 Dec 1839 in Bladen Co., NC, the third child and oldest son of William and Susan Hester Sims.

In about Feb 1845, the family moved to southern Alabama.  This must have been quite an adventure for a 5 year old boy.

The federal census for 1850 (recorded 9 Dec 1850) listed them in Choctaw Co., AL.  The family included: William (b. 1805), Susan (b. 1812), Sarah (b. 1835), Harriet Amanda (b. 1837), Robert (b. 1839), John L. (b. 1845), William K. (b. 1848), James N. (b. 1849).  They lived next door to Benjamin (b. 1783) and Narcissa (b. 1793) Sims, also from North Carolina.  They were probably William's uncle and aunt.

Sadly, about 1851 William, Bob's father, died.  At 12 he became the oldest man in the family.

About 1852 his mother married Lamuel McMichael, a widower from Georgia with children.  In 1854 his mother gave birth to Caroline McMichael, his half-sister.

The federal census for 1860 (taken 3 Sept 1860) recorded Bob living with Robert T. (b. 1825) and Susan E. (b. 1830) Sims and their 4 children.  This Robert T. is Benjamin and Narcissa's son, probably Bob's first cousin once removed.  Again the family next door is related.  It included: Sarah Sims Foster (b. 1822), Drury Foster (b. 1816), a disabled shoemaker, and their children: Cordelia W. (b. 1844), Benjamin S. (b. 1846), and Ann M. (b. 1854).  This Sarah was probably Robert T's sister, another of Bob's cousins.

In 1861 Bob enlisted from Womack Hill in Company C of the 22nd AL regiment of the Confederate Army.  Beginning as a private, he served nearly 4 years.  Early in the war his officers were: Captain Sidney Prince, Colonel Harry T. Toulmin, Lt. Frank Lyon in the army of General Braxton Bragg.  Bragg led his forces in battles at Perryville (8 Oct 1862), Murfreesboro (31 Dec 1862 and 2 Jan 1863), Chickamauga (19-20 Sept. 1863) and Chattanooga (23-25 Nov 1863).  From the number of wounded and the number killed, this war must have been a bloody, living nightmare.

On the battlefield Bob was struck by a spent bouncing cannon ball.  It hit him on the back of his shoulder at the base of his neck.  After the battle was over he was found lying in the sun groaning by Mr. Cook.  This good samaritan dragged him into the shade, filled his felt hat with water, got him to drink and so rescued and revived him.  Years later Bob would name one of his children for this dear friend.

On 30 Apr 1864 the 22nd AL was led by Col. Benjamin R. Hart.  This was part of Deas's Brigade under Brig. Gen. Zachariah C. Deas.  This brigade was one fourth of Hindman's Division under Major Gen. Thomas C. Hindman.  It in turn was commanded by Lt. Gen. John B. Hood.  Hood's corp was part of the forces under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's Army of the Tennessee.

During the battle at Resaca, GA (in NW GA) on 16 May 1864, Bob was captured and taken prisoner of war.  On 20 May 1864 he was forwarded to Louisville, KY to be transferred to Camp Morton, near Indianapolis, IN on May 21.

Family legend records that he was held prisoner on Johnston's Island north of Sandusky, Ohio in Lake Erie.  Over 2000 men were held here under harsh, primitive conditions.  Straw and blankets served as beds.  Some died of smallpox.  All coped with insufficient food and sinks (toilets) without drainage.  In the inspector's report of 10 Feb 1865, the health of the prisoners was described as bad.

The arrival of a letter for a prisoner who had died inspired the collaborative writing of a poem, "The Letter That Came Too Late".  This was printed in More Heart Throbs, a collection of poems compiled by Joe Mitchell Chapple about 1948 from Grosset & Dunlap in New York.  Because this prison held captured Confederate officers,  it's not clear if Bob was there.  He may have been held at Camp Morton until his parole 19 Feb 1865.
  
Just before his parole, Bob received a folded valentine from his cousin Cordelia Foster.  Each of 24 verses is revealed by opening a fold.  From about a 2 inch square, it becomes about a 10 inch square when completely unfolded.  The family has a copy of this charming old valentine.

On 19 Feb 1965 he was parolled and transferred for exchange to General Hospital No. 9 in Richmond, VA.  He arrived there 28 Feb 1865.

In about late April Bob reached home, having walked most of the way from Virginia.  He arrived home wearing a dark homespun wool dress suit, possibly the gift of a generous family en route who had lost a son in the war.

On 19 Dec 1867 Bob married Elizabeth Ann Campbell (b. 5 Nov 1843, in Marlboro Co., SC), daughter of Elias and Annice Pearson Campbell.  (The Campbell family moved to southern Alabama early in 1852.)  Bob and Elizabeth lived in a log cabin with a dirt floor on Oaktuppa Creek in Choctaw Co.  Bob cut, squared and rafted timbers down the Tombigbee River for sale in Mobile.  Having attended little school, Bob's reading ability was limited.  Elizabeth taught him to read well and he began reading the Bible.  Over the next months he read the Bible through several times!

About 1870 the family moved to a larger log house with two fireplaces situated on a hillside.  This house was encircled by a porch.  An earthen oven in the yard was used to bake sweet potatoes.  Bob farmed and grew fruit in orchards.  When he went to Mobile, he would carry his friend and former Colonel, Judge Harry Toulmin, a basket of peaches or apples from his trees.

From his reading Bob developed knowledge of the use of herbs in medicine.  The American Botanist and Family Physician written in 1824 by John Monroe was among his references.  In rural communities physicians were scarce and his neighbors respected and depended on his free advice.  Yearly he collected and stored fresh herbs in the loft of the barn.  Half of the loft was filled with dried plants.  Jim McEachern remembered as a child going with his father to get advice and medicine from Bob Sims.  Later Jim McEachern operated a jewelery store and worked as a watchmaker in Ellisville in Jones Co., MS.

At this time Bob was a black-haired, blue-eyed, thick chested man weighing about 185 lbs.  J. J. Altman, a Choctaw Co. lawyer at that time described him as "a quick spoken, quick witted, farmer in good circumstances."  His brother Neal described him as stout, brave and fearless.  Elizabeth described him as the kindest, gentlest man you could imagine.  He attempted to live exactly according to biblical precepts.  The neighbors admired his integrity, his sobriety, his knowledge of biblical teachings and his assistance to the sick.  The "Atlanta Constitution" credited him with electing two members of Congress.  His successful farming produced surpluses of corn and fruit.  

About 1875 while serving as a deacon in the Womack Hill Baptist Church, he discovered theft in the church.  Each Sunday two offerings were collected: one regular and one for foreign missions.  Knowing that there were no ties to foreign missionaries, Bob observed that each Sunday the collection for missions was placed in the pocket of another deacon, Jarl Kennedy.  This continued week after week.  During church one Sunday Bob confronted Jarl Kennedy with his observations.  Kennedy denied the charge and to Bob's surprise, the minister supported Kennedy.  Not one to condone theft, Bob refused to compromise with Kennedy and his followers.  This open rupture split the community into two factions: Sims supporters and Kennedy supporters.   

A young black boy asked Bob's brother Jim to get him a $.25 barlow pocket knife at the store.  He gave Jim a dollar to pay for it.  When Jim mentioned to the merchant who the knife was for, the merchant refused to give Jim any change.  The price for blacks was $1.  Angrily Jim cursed the merchant for cheating the boy.

Unable to sell all his surplus fruit and grain, Bob began making wines and distilled liquors.  Bob and his brother, Neal, built a cane mill from beech blocks to squeeze the juice from sugar cane.  The juice was cooked in an iron kettle to make syrup.  With this sweetener the liquor was made at a still at a spring in front of the house.  While making liquor was legal, selling it required a license.  Bob applied for a license to sell spirits.  His application was denied, possibly due to the influence of opponents.
His friend Judge Toulmin advised him to set his spirits out at the roadside where buyers could leave a contribution.  This brought in a steady money supply.

In the Spring of 1877 the Rev. H. M. Moss and David Wright brought charges against Bob for his behavior in church.  Bob had kissed the Bible and remarked that it was much abused there.  This charge was not pursued by the Grand Jury.  Over the following months and years a series of such charges were brought to harass Bob Sims.  His religious convictions led him to respond to harassment, even physical abuse, passively, without resistance.

About 1878 in Mobile, Bob met Prof. Felix Levasseur, a Frenchman and teacher.  He had survived an ocean shipwreck.  After that trauma and his rescue at sea, he was unwilling to risk another sea voyage to return home to France.  Bob persuaded him to come home with him to establish a school.  Bob built a cabin on his farm which served as the school for all the children in the neighborhood.  He introduced the French classics by Tolstoi, Victor Hugo, and Voltaire.  He taught pronunciation of words such as Galapagos and platypus, some with a french flair!  The children wrote on slates.

On 8 June 1880 the federal census recorded Bob as a farmer.  Bailey was described as a farm laborer.  Bailey, Laura, and Beatrice attended school within the year.  Waldo was only a few days old.  Two of Elizabeth's brothers, W. G. and J. H. Campbell, lived with the family.  They were also farm laborers. 

About 1880 Bob bought a parrot for the children.  Coming home he set it in its cage behind a tree down the road from the house.  At home he told the children to go look behind that tree.  They were delighted.  The parrot learned to say only one phrase, "Come here, Cookie".

On Oct 14, 1881 Prof. Levasseur married Harriet Sikes (?) and raised a family including a son, Felix.  (This marriage record in the court house is incomplete (Book 1, p. 351)).  In July 1890 he was elected to the executive committee of the County Alliance, a populist party.

In the Summer of 1889 Bob purchased a printing press in Mobile, freighted it on a steamboat to Lenore's Landing and hauled it in a wagon to the house.  Beginning in August 1889 and continuing until May 1891, he published 14 issues of a journal.  Entitled "The Veil is Rent", it was subtitled, "A Journal created to show the 'Truth of God as it is written.'  And its perversion by the Devil's Iscariots who 'Sop in the dish' with Jesus Christ."  Each issue included four 3-column pages of small print.  Laura, Beatrice, Ruby and 12 year old Cookie set type.  (Caroline McMichael Moseley, Bob's half sister, preserved copies of "The Veil is Rent" providing them to the family.  One set has been donated to the Alabama State Archives in Montgomery.)  With religious zeal it exposed the corruption of preachers and churches.  Copies were mailed to subscribers in other states (Atlanta, GA, Mt. Vernon, Iowa and Waukesha, Wisconsin) for $.25 a year.  Printing and distributing his ideas further angered and enraged Bob's enemies.

On 23 Mar 1891 he and Elizabeth sold 100 acres of land to T. M. McIlwain.  The land was situated in section 6, township 10 and range 3 in Choctaw Co.

With a warrant for his arrest for selling liquor on 20 Aug 1891 Bob was seized and carried to Lenore's Landing to be transported and imprisoned in Mobile.  At the landing a group of armed supporters released him.  In their escape gunfire killed two guards (Frank Dahlberg and Dr. A. B. Pugh) and Bailey, Bob and Elizabeth's oldest son.  Jim Sims, Bob's brother was seriously wounded by several gunshots.  The foes then took him and lynched him.  This tragedy began to engulf the family.

Bob with his followers became fugitives.  On Aug 28th Thomas C. Elliot chaired a large meeting at the Womack Hill Baptist Church.  T. E. Trice was assistant to the chair and F. A. Tate was secretary.  Elliot made a strong speech condemning the doctrine of Bob Sims and denouncing him and his followers as "blood thirsty outlaws".  A secret committee of 12 was appointed to investigate any believed to be Sims followers.  A reward of $400 was offered for this "felon".  The governor added an additional $400 to the reward.

On 23 Dec 1891 Elisha Mack, a black man, in the store overheard a plan to burn Bob's house and shoot any that tried to escape the conflagration.  Opponents were to bring their guns and gather at John McMillan's house to carry out this plan.  Elisha Mack shared what he had overheard with Bob.  Remembering military strategy from his Civil War experience, Bob decided to counterattack.  With Moses Savage, Con Savage, Con's two sons and other supporters Bob burned the McMillan house killing several of those that had planned to kill him.  John Kennedy and Belle McKenzie were killed; Mr. McCrory was a crippled survivor.

After a seige of his home, on 25 Dec 1891, word came that the foes were bringing a cannon to end the confrontation.  Bob surrendered to be taken to the jail in Butler.  He knew he would never reach Butler.  He told Elizabeth as he walked out, "Cook some greens and cornbread, old woman.  I'll be back for supper."  He was lynched by the mob.  

Moses Savage, Con Savage, Con's two sons (Tyree and either Tom or Will), Elisha Mack and Edmund Jones (also known as Harry Hinton), a black man, were all hung. (Neal vanished, possibly going to Texas.)  John Sims, an uninvolved brother, had sought protection from the Sheriff, was held in jail, but upon demand by the rabble was released from jail by the Sheriff to the mob and hung.  The mob ruled.

Bob was buried in the Bob Sims cemetery on the hillside north of the old home of Caroline and Jim Moseley.  (In 1996 Buster Carlisle lives at this site.)  His grave is marked by a Confederate veteran's gravestone.  It reads "Robert Sims 22 Ala Inf C S A."
