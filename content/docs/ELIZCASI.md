On 5 Nov 1843 Elizabeth was born in Marlboro Co, SC.  She was the oldest child of Elias and Annice Pearson Campbell.

The federal census for 1850 (taken 12 Sept 1850) listed Elias, Annice, Elizabeth and 3 younger children living with Sarah Britton, her grandmother.  Sarah Britton owned the farm valued at $350.  Although both her grandfathers were dead, Elizabeth grew up knowing at least one of her grandmothers.

On 3 Nov 1851 her Dad sold a family of slaves.  She grew up in a household in which slaves did the work.

About 1852, having sold Sarah Britton's farm, the family moved to Southern Alabama.  In either Dec 1851 or early 1852, when Elizabeth was 8, the move was made in ox-drawn wagons.  With the slaves she probably helped care for the younger children: James Alonzo (b. 1846), Joseph Lawrence (b. 1848), Sallie (b. 1850), and William Gransy (b. 16 Feb 1852).  Families in the wagon train camped at night along the way.  Elizabeth remembered the boys, both black and white, running the dogs in the woods as they chased and bayed rabbits and coons.

On 19 Dec 1867 Elizabeth married Robert Sims, son of William and Susan Hester Sims.  Born in 1839 in Bladen Co., NC, Bob came with his family to Alabama in 1845.  He was a civil war veteran.  He cut and squared timbers which he rafted down the Tombigbee River to be sold in Mobile.  Elizabeth and Bob lived first in a log cabin with a dirt floor on Oaktuppa Creek in Choctaw Co.  Years later Elizabeth described Bob as the kindest, gentlest person that you could imagine.

Their children were:

1) Zacheous Bailey Sims (b. 1868; d. 1891).
2) Laura Eugenia Inez Sims (b. 1870; md. John Horton).
3) Clara Beatrice Sims (b. 1873; d. 10 Feb 1901; md. Will Green).
4) Ruby Magnolia Sims (b. 1875; d. 14 Jun 1959; md. Wyatt Jordan).
5) Elizabeth Cook Sims (b. 1877; d. 1964?; md. Zadie Norwood).
6) Epaminondas Waldo Sims (b. 1880; d. May 1946; md. Etta Idell Nixon).
7) Ignacius Coriolanus Sims (b. 1882; d. Jan 1970; md. Margaret Taylor).
8) Robert Solon Sims (b. 1886; d. Aug 1976).

The names they chose for their children reflected their appreciation of historical Greek and Biblical figures.  After Laura's birth the family moved to a larger log house encircled by a porch situated on a hillside.  The higher site was healthier.  Bob farmed and grew fruit.

Sadly, Elizabeth's father, Elias died on 4 Dec 1868, aged only 54.  Then only about three years later her mother died on 22 Dec 1871, aged 55.  Surely the hardships of the Civil war contributed to their early deaths.  Decembers proved tragic for Elizabeth.

The climax of the conflict between Bob and the Baptist Church began 20 Aug 1891.  On that day Bailey, Elizabeth's and Bob's oldest son was shot in the back and killed.  On Dec 25th after a seige of their home by their foes, Robert was taken and hung.  His discovery of theft by deacons in the Baptist church, his kind treatment of Negros, his own religious zeal, and his stubborn refusal to yield to opposing forces led to this sad conclusion.  Elizabeth and the family sought shelter with her brother Joe Campbell and his family that night.  What a heart-rending ordeal this was.

After the foes burned Elizabeth and Bob's house, to prevent further persecution Laura and Beatrice went to the Governor of Alabama, Thomas Goode Jones, and appealed to him for protection for the family.  He did nothing.

About 1892 Elizabeth moved the family to Winchester in Wayne Co., MS for several months.  They then moved to Waynesboro where they lived several years.  Near there Mr. Davis published the county newspaper.  As all four girls could set type, they worked for Mr. Davis.  

Later they lived in Stonewall for several years and then Heidelberg in Clarke Co. for 2 years.  There all the girls, Waldo and Iggie worked at looms in a cotton mill.  Waldo was responsible for 20-25 looms.  When the boss told Laura that if they didn't take Solie out of school and put him to work, all of them would lose their jobs, the family moved to Eastabutchie in Jones Co.  

There Waldo worked for the Eastman-Gardner Lumber Co. grading lumber in the planing mill for $1 a day.  The family was so careful with their money that after 100 days, Waldo paid $100 for the house where they lived.  Elizabeth was to live on this place one mile northeast of Estabutchie for the remainder of her life.

The federal census in 1900 listed Elizabeth as a farmer.  They owned their home free of a mortgage.  As the two older girls have married, only the five younger children lived with their mother.  Ruby was 24; Cookie, 21; Waldo, 20; Iggie, 15; and Solie, 13.

Tragically on 10 Feb 1901, Beatrice died of tuberculosis.  She had met and married Will Green at the cotton mill in Stonewall (or Heidelberg).  They moved to Augusta, GA, his home, where he worked at another cotton mill.  Sadly their infant Edward Green (b. 5 Jan 1901) died from colitis (gastroenteritis) only months after his mother (d. 28 May 1901).  While at nearby Ft. Gordon, GA in training Hugo Sims put gravestones to his great aunt and her son's graves in Magnolia Cemetery.

The federal census for 1910 (recorded 26 Apr 1910) listed Iggie as the head of Elizabeth's household.  Both Iggie, 27 and Solie, 23, were described as farmers.  Of the girls only Ruby continued to live at home.

About 1912 a former slave came from Mobile, AL on the train to visit with Elizabeth.  He stayed several days with the family before returning to Mobile.  What a fine compliment this was.

On 30 Jan 1917 Elizabeth applied for a pension as the widow of a Confederate veteran.  We have an example of her handwriting and her signature from this form.  She was right-handed.  This pension initially provided $20 a month which was quite a help.

From this period Victor Sims (b. 1908), Elizabeth's grandson, has a treasure of memories.  Now a small, slightly stooped woman, Elizabeth twisted her grey hair back into a bun at her neck.  In Winter she wrapped an elbow-length brown velvet cape with a braided edge around her shoulders.  On special occasions she always dressed in a long black dress with black pumps and a black bonnet.  She used face powder, but not lipstick.  At least once she rode the train to visit Laura (Aunt Sis) and her family in Purvis.  The family revered her.

The 1920 federal census (taken 22 Jan 1920) listed her as the head of the household.  Ruby and Solie lived with their mother and Iggie lived next door.  Both are described as farmers.

About 1920 Waldo drove his mother in a car to see a silent motion picture.  For $.10 admission they saw a show at the Strand Theater in Hattiesburg.

The family had a "New Home" peddle sewing machine.  They mended torn clothes and made dresses and quilts.  For washing they used soap made from cooking brown balls of lye (potash) with fat, primarily pork fat.  Soap making was necessary once or twice a year.  Later they bought a laundry soap named "Pearline".

Elizabeth cooked eggs and cornbread on top of the wood stove.  They canned peaches (without sugar), tomatoes, and butterbeans.  They used half gallon jars with screw lids that compressed new rubber rings against their edge.  They also dried peaches.  The fruit was cut from the pit, placed on a sheet of tin in the hot sun for about a week and then heated in the oven to kill any insect eggs.  Stored in a pillow case, these peaches were made into scrumptious fried peach tarts.

Every evening she sat in a small rocker beside the fireplace and a window.  Wearing small round gold-framed glasses, she would read the Pathfinder, a weekly news magazine from Washington, DC, or Harpers magazine, or the Progressive Farmer.  She was keenly interested in government and national affairs.  She would ask Walley about the President.  She encouraged moderation in all things.  Both she and Ruby read to the grandchildren.  Victor remembers his grandmother reading to him from a flat, blue geography book.  The stories illustrated different cultures  such as one story, "Chug-a-loo", about an eskimo child.  Beatrice Powers (b. 1903), a granddaughter, recalled Summers when her grandmother and Aunt Ruby read aloud as "the happiest time of my life."

While resting every evening in her rocker, using a black-gum twig "toothbrush", she would take one dip of snuff.  The moistened flared end was dipped into the square, brown bottle of Levi Garrett snuff and placed between her cheek and gums.  The bottle she got for Christmas lasted all year.  The twig was kept with the bottle of snuff on the window sill.

She enjoyed Iggie playing the fiddle.  Her favorite tune was "Bonaparte's Retreat".  In Hattiesburg a company that made candy offered bargains in Summer to prevent the sticks of peppermint from melting (with no refrigeration).  Iggie kept boxes of peppermint sticks at his mother's home.

In Nov 1929, sadly this gentle lady died of a stroke.  She collapsed on the steps between the house and the kitchen.  Laura who was there visiting found her mother and urgently called, "Come help me.  Momma has fallen."  Elizabeth responded, "I did not fall."  Those were her last words.  They were apt for a strong woman who withstood much adversity. 

At Jack Conner's store in Seminary Victor bought a varnished coffin for $125.  Lonnie Aultman delivered it.  After the wake, the casket was carried to the cemetery on Iggie's new 1929 Ford A model one ton truck.  The Estabutchie cemetery  is located west off old highway 11 north.  Rev. Hardy Norsworthy, former sheriff of Forest County and a friend of the family from Wayne Co. conducted the service.  An admirer of the family, it was easy for him to praise this lovely woman.

Later Iggie, Solie and Ruby would rest beside their mother in this cemetery.
