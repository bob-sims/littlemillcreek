May was born July 24, 1895, the first child of Bill and Dora Havens.

Maye attended Mississippi State College for Women in Columbus, MS.  She got a license to teach elementary grades.  

She taught at Vancleave at the hexagonal school.  Later she taught at Escatawpa, north of Moss Point.  While working there she met Vincent.

She married Vincent A. Torres (b. Dec 4, 1891) on Jan. 1, 1920 at her home.  W. C. "Bill" Havens, her first cousin once removed, served as Circuit Clerk at the time they applied for their marriage license.

As an adult she had her mother's black wavy hair.  About 5'5" tall, she weighed about 145 lbs.  A sensitivity to light caused her to squint her eyes and blink often.  She had a distinctive, gravelly voice.

They had 3 sons: 
1) Glenn William (b. June 10, 1923; md. Wanda Glenn).  
2) an infant boy (d. October 1924).  
3) Charles Cecile (b. Sept. 7, 1928; md. Annette Tisdale).

May furnished their home with handsome antique furniture.  She had a beautiful heavy, walnut bedroom suite with marble-topped dresser.  She learned to recane old chairs.  She replaced the cane in several.

She kept one or two short-haired terriers in a room behind the kitchen.

For her granddaughters she made elaborate doll clothes.  She sewed zippers and sequins on miniature wedding dresses.

About 1952 May began growing amaryllis lilies.  She spread the thin black seeds in a shallow box of soil and sprinkled soil over them.  She covered the soil with a corn sack that was kept wet.  Seedlings were transplanted twice.  About 8 months after they sprouted, they were large enough to be set out in the yard.  She planted rows of lilies east of her house.  She produced a profusion of beautiful blooms.

She also had a keen interest in camellias.  She was a member of the Gulf Coast Camellia Society.
 
Glenn died in a tragic car accident Jan. 6, 1970.  En route to Mobile on a bridge his car malfunctioned-possibly the steering froze-and he was killed.  A chemical engineer, Glenn worked in the coatings department at the International Paper Co. in Moss Point.

Charles and Annette gave his parents a 50th wedding anniversary party at their home in Moss Point.  Glenn's death forced a delay in the celebration.

May developed a tremor and was diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease.  She maintained her usual positive attitude.

The last time I saw her, Dad and I visited with them in their kitchen as May canned fig preserves.  I was amazed as I watched her ignore the tremor of her hands as she packed boiling figs in sterile jars.

May died Dec. 16, 1981.  A fatal heart attack caused her to fall from her chair in the kitchen.  She is buried at Griffin cemetery in Moss Point.
