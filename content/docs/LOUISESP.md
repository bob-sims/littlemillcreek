Born 4 Nov 1915, Louise was the fourth child and second daughter of Camille and Daisy Caldwell Seymour.

She attended school at the St. Martin school.  Due to low enrollment, the school could not operate her junior year in high school.  For that year she lived with her Aunt and Uncle Dora Seymour Havens and Bill Havens and their family and attended school in Vancleave.  She returned the next year to St. Martin for her senior year.  About 1934 she graduated from St. Martin High School.

She and her cousin May Scarborough Graham (b. May 2, 1916; daughter of James and Olivia Seymour Scarborough) were good friends.

Louise worked for about 4 years for Handleman's Store on the north side of Howard Ave. in downtown Biloxi.  It was a popular clothing store that thrived before the development of shopping malls.

About 1937 she married Andy Luther Page (b. 11 Jan 1912).  His family lived in Vancleave, MS.

They made their home on Jim Ramsey Rd.  They were members of the Northside Assembly of God Church.  Louise taught Sunday school and worked with pre-school children there.

They had the following children:

1) Raymond A. Page (b. 1938?; md. Dorothy Poole; live in Vancleave, MS).
2) Ona Lee Page (b.    ; md. Jerry Edwin Williams).
3) Carolyn Page (b. 1940; md. Joe Ronald Crawford, live in Baileytown, AL).
4) Warren Carmelious Page (b.     ; md. Grace Lee; live in Clinton, MS).
5) Shannon L. Page (b.   ; not md. in 1997).
6) Ronald Floyd Page (b.   ; md. Patti Howell; live in Lucedale, MS).
7) Donald Wayne Page (b.   ; md. Donna _____).
8) Robert Dale Page (b.    ; not md. in 1997).

Louise was really a hard worker, according to her cousin, Elsie Fletcher.  

In about 1952 Andy began selling building materials in Ocean Springs.  In about 1958 he and Louise opened City Lumber Co. there.  It flourished from a large metal building on the south side of highway 90 east of Ocean Springs (also known then as 1400 Bienville Blvd.).  Initially Andy served as president of the company and Louise served as manager and bookkeeper.  Beginning about 1968 their son Raymond worked as vice president with his parents.  In 1972 he served as manager.

Andy was an active member of the masonic lodge.

Sadly, about 1977 Louise suffered a stroke.  She required care.

At that time Raymond took over the lumber business as the president.  His sister Ona Lee Williams worked as secretary and treasurer.  They operated it until about 1981, when it closed.

(In 1997 the yellow building stands vacant.)

Gradually Louise's health deteriorated.

Sadly, Andy died 6 Jan 1991.  He's buried at the Seymour Cemetery off Jim Ramsey Cutoff Rd. north of Ocean Springs.

Louise died 26 Sept. 1993.  She's buried beside Andy.
