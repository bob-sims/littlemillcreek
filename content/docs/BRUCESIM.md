Bruce was born July 10, 1906 the oldest child of Waldo and Idell Nixon Sims in Estabutchie, MS in their home in the Bonner Store Bldg.

He first attended school in Moselle.  Teachers there urged him to use his right hand.  He continued to write with his left hand.

Uncle Iggie gave Bruce and his younger brother Victor a wild black nannie goat about 1912.  She had twin nannie kids.  Bruce claimed the black one and Victor the white one.  They ate corn and spilled cottonseed from around the barn.  From that original nannie they had 30-40 goats in 1920 when they moved to Seminary.

In about 1915 at age 9 Bruce became sick with malaria.  He was seriously ill.  His parents bought quinine powder, a white powder, and filled empty capsules with it.  The entire family took these capsules.  Smokey fires in the yard were used to reduce mosquitoes around the house.  The first window screen appeared about 1918.  Waldo built screen doors and covered the windows and porches.

About 1917 Bruce went to stay for a couple of months with Jim and Vicie Hearn, his uncle and aunt, at Madison, MS.  He attended school there.  During winter in very cold weather the family drove to Madison to bring Bruce home.

About 1918 Waldo ordered Bruce a "Sentinel" bicycle from the Meade Cycle Co. in Illinois.  It featured chrome handlebars, tires with tubes, 28" wheels.  Painted green with a yellow stripe, it had stiff hubs (not a coaster bike).  To brake it you put your shoe above the front tire.  It cost $28.

About that same year Waldo bought the family's first automobile.  They drove from Moselle to Woolmarket in Harrison Co. to visit their cousins, the Campbells, and Mr. and Mrs. Perry Castle, an enterprising truck farmer.  (Earlier, for several years, the Castles had rented Waldo's farm at Moselle.)  Mr. Castle and Waldo had set some baited hooks in a bayou near their house and on the first trip to check the hooks they caught a 75# loggerhead turtle.  The turtle locked on to a pole with its beak.  One man carried the pole and another carried its tail to bring it to the house.  They feasted on turtle soup, turtle sausage, etc.

On that same trip Waldo bought the boys a single shot Daisy air rifle.  He paid $3.25 for it!  After both shot repeatedly at a robin, Bruce killed it.  To operate it, you cocked it, put a pellet in the barrel and tipped it downward with your finger over the barrel tip because sometimes the pellet would not stick. Once during this process, Bruce fired a pellet into the tip of his forefinger.  Waldo pressed the skin on the sides of his finger and the pellet popped out.

In 1920 the family moved to Seminary.

That year for $12 he got a storekeeper, Louis Lott, Wiley's brother, to order him his first shotgun.  It was a Columbia 12 guage with a 32 inch full choke single barrel.  The boys hunted rabbits and squirrels in the Fall and Winter.  They skinned their game and their mother cooked it.  All the wild turkey and deer populations had been decimated.  There were none to hunt.

He thoroughly enjoyed both hunting and especially, fishing.  With his brother Victor and cousins, Bruce fished using a Buell lure.  A triangular brass lure with three trailing hooks, it spun as it moved through the water.  They also gigged fish in shallows with a 3 or 4 hooked gig made from straightened large hooks attached to handles.  On Summer nights they caught red-bellied perch, small trout and suckers.  They scaled and cleaned the fish. 

Bruce played ball on the Seminary team.  He played left field.  Players wore striped uniforms with knee pants and socks.  They bought cleats that they attached to leather "scout" shoes.  The Seminary team played Collins, Bassfield, Sumrall and Sanford on sunny days in Summer.

At about 18 years of age Bruce dropped out of the 10th or llth grade.

His mother remarked, "I've never known a Nixon that didn't wash his hands and face and comb his hair before coming to the table to eat."  Bruce responded, "I know a half-breed that doesn't!"

Mr. Hartman, an Austrian, taught oil painting in Hattiesburg at his home.  Bruce took weekly lessons with D. O. Watkins for about a year.  Mr. Hartman was an accomplished artist.  He had painted a 4' x 6' scene of a girl milking a cow.  Victor said that you could see the hairs on the back of her neck.  Mr. Hartman also  carved tombstones.  He had twin sons; one was named Tom.

In about 1925 after Waldo purchased a new Model T Ford, he gave Bruce his older 1918 Model T.  It had a new 1923 four cylinder engine and was hand cranked.  Bruce removed the body to make a strip down.

On December 14, 1930, Bruce married Annie Lucille Lott daughter of Wiley and Annie Lott of Seminary.  They took a honeymoon trip to Hattiesburg.  Throughout their lives they were devoted to each other.

From about 1928 to 1930 Bruce operated a meatmarket and cafe.  As the only one in town it was prosperous.  Bruce and Victor slaughtered beef.  After shooting, they cut the animal's throat to bleed it.  The carcass was skinned and the hide salted.  The carcass was split open and gutted saving the liver, the tripe and the melt (pancreas).  It was chilled overnight in an icehouse.  Using a meat saw (a long hacksaw) the carcass was split lengthwise.  The brain and tongue were removed and the meat cut into roasts, steaks, etc. to be sold.  Bruce sold one or two beeves a week.  In Winter they also butchered 100 lb hogs.  Bruce made sausage but did not cure hams or bacon.

The Seminary Cafe was open from 6:30 am to 9 pm seven days a week.  Diners sat at a long counter or in chairs around a row of three or four cloth-covered tables.  Bruce and Lucille cooked, served and cleaned.  They sold primarily soft drinks, sandwiches and hamburgers. 

The entire family moved to Hattiesburg in Forrest Co. in 1930.  Waldo rented the Kennedy Bldg. across from Methodist Hospital.  Bruce operated a Standard Oil Gas station there.  Because of the awful economic conditions prevalent in the country, it was not profitable.
  
Bruce and Lucille returned to Seminary.  Bruce worked as a plumber and mechanic.

In 1932 Governor Mike Conner, a native of Seminary and a family friend, hired Bruce to work at the Insane Asylum in Meridian.  They moved to Meridian where he worked as a carpenter.  One of the patients there, a Mr. Murray, was a genius carpenter.  Bruce was impressed that he could build circular staircases.

With money earned in Meridian, Bruce bought land and built his home in Seminary in 1934.  He purchased the land from Wiley Lott.  He built, wired and plumbed the house himself.  

He continued to fish and about 1936 caught a champion fish.  On a set hook baited with a 6" mud catfish he pulled a 45 lb tabby catfish from the English Turn hole in Black Creek.  It was skinned and eaten.

Robert I. Ingalls from Birmingham started Ingall's Shipbuilding in Pascagoula in 1938.  He entrusted a team from Birmingham with oversight of operations.  First they built barges.  Then they built a cargo ship, the S. S. Exchequer, the world's first all welded steel ship.  It was completed in 1940.

From about 1939-41 Bruce worked as a machinist at Ingalls Shipbuilding (later Litton owned) in Pascagoula.  He worked on the S. S. Exchequer.  The pay was 65 cents an hour.

In the early years at the shipyard, most machinists had worked on shrimpboats with 4" shafts.  Cargo ships typically had 22" shafts.  Bruce, having grown up in a cotton gin, was at home with larger equipment.  He and Marshall Smith loved to work on heavy machinery and became expert at it.  Bruce was a key person for solving problems.
 
Ingalls built many C 3 cargo ships under federal contract.  Bruce went to sea on a trail run on one.  After he discovered particles of metal in the main engine oil, he recommended to Mr. Peattie, the head operator, that they should turn off the engine and tow the vessel back to the yard.  Contrary to his advice, they continued to operate the engine back into port.  Then they had to return the 16" gear to the manufacturer.  It had lost metal.

For several months in 1945 Bruce and Lucille lived in San Francisco, CA.  There he worked at Hunter Point as a machinist.  They repaired and refurbished submarines.  After August 1945 when the second world war ended, they returned to Mississippi.

Bruce was employed by Bolling Machine Works in New Orleans.  They made shafts, bearings and anchor chains for ships.  Each link of the huge chains weighed 100 lbs!  The entire chain weighed 20 tons.  The chains were made from heavy rod stock.  Sawed at an angle, the stock was bent by a blacksmith to fit a jig.  After looping through the previous link, the ends were welded together to complete the new link.

Late in May 1946, Bruce's father, Waldo died.  He succombed to pancreatic and liver cancer at the old Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula.  Bruce was grieved by the loss of his father.  

Over the next years the couple lived in several states as Bruce set up machinery for new paper mills.  He worked at Moss Point, MS; Bowwater, TN; Roanoke Rapids, NC; Mobile, AL; Pensacola, FL; and in Louisiana and Ohio.

In July 1959 Idell Sims, his mother, died of heart failure.   

Late that year Bruce and Lucille settled in Pascagoula.  They lived in the house previously occupied by Bruce's mother on Canty St. diagonally across the street from the home of his sister, Grace, and Louis McCaffrey.  He would live here the remainder of his life.

In about 1967 Bruce installed heavy machinery from Germany in the new West Bank facility of Ingalls Shipbuilding.  Frank Vice said that if it had not been for Bruce Sims they would never have got the machinery set.

In August 1969 Hurricane Camille devastated the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Lucille was away from home visiting her family for several days.  Bruce remained home through this violent storm.  Heavy rains were accompanied by winds blowing at more than 200 mph.  Bruce smoked a cigarette in the middle of Canty St. while the wind raged above the tree-tops.  Accumulated water from rainfall and the rear drainage ditch climbed toward the house.  It reached floor-level before it began to recede.  A big pecan tree south of the house due to wind damage and weakened roots, began to lean.  Unfortunately, the wind direction shifted as the storm progressed causing the tree to fall on the house.  By his presence Bruce saved many goods from damage, but because this was hard on him he vowed to evacuate the next time a hurricane struck.    

Thereafter he worked at the Standard Oil refinery in Pascagoula.  Later it became a Chevron facility.  In August 1970 he hurt his shoulder while working.  Surgery reattached muscles.

In 1971 he retired from Standard Oil.  He enjoyed retirement.  In particular he enjoyed conversation on general ideas and current events.

He resumed woodworking he had begun as a boy.  Mr. Jones, a blacksmith operated a foot-powered lathe in Ellisville.  After observing this at age 15, he built a foot-powered wood lathe.  The boys made rolling pins and bats.  Using a metal lathe after he retired Bruce made several lamps from cedar.  He built a stand for the globe. 

From a California gold rush railway iron, given to him by his nephew Hugo Sims, he crafted miniature anvils.  From power hacksaw blades (1.5" x 14-16") he made nice kitchen butcherknives.  He gave his fine handiwork as gifts to relatives.

Although he broke a rib about 1950 and broke a leg about 1970, generally Bruce had very good health.  However he smoked cigarettes.  He stopped smoking about 1956, but resumed about 1959.  Coughing and general weakness caused him to quit smoking in October l983.  He never fully regained his stamina.

He died of a sudden heart attack about 6 am April 27, 1984, at his home on Canty St.  Fortunately, Lucille's sister Bernice, and her daughters, Shirley Allen and Peg Betz were there for a visit and they administered to him.  He was a casualty of smoking.

He was buried from O'Bryant-O'Keefe Funeral Home in Pascagoula.  Rev. Marvin Dean conducted the service.  Cindy V. Russell sang, and Ann Breland and Shirley Allen sang a duet.  His grave at Machpelah cemetery is marked by a concrete slab poured by Victor.  The inscription on his tomb reads, "Gentleman and Scholar".
