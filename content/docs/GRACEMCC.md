Grace was born May 10, 1910, the third child and first daughter of Waldo and Idell Sims.  She was born in Estabutchie in Jones Co. MS.  Halley's comet lit up the sky at the time.  One newborn girl in the community was named Halley for the comet.

As a child she had the chicken pox and the measles.  Her measles case was so bad that she remembered that her eyes were closed for three days.

Grace first attended school in Moselle, MS.  Then in 1920 the family moved to Seminary, where her schooling continued.

She remembered asking her mother to show her how to cut up a chicken.  In home economics class in high school she remembered making a yellow dress out of indian head (a linen-like cotton).  Thus began her sewing expertise. 

She graduated from high school in 1928.  Thereafter she enrolled as a student at State Teachers College (now USM).  She majored in home economics.  Her best instructors were Miss Campbell in home ec and Mrs Switzer in art.

On 8 Nov 1929 the "Hattiesburg American" newspaper carried in its news from Seminary column the note that Mrs. E. W. Sims and young daughter Margaret are visiting Grace Sims who is a student at State Teachers College.

In 1931  Grace married Louis Patric McCaffrey (b.1904), son of James and Annie McCaffrey in Laurel.  A Justice of the Peace performed the ceremony.

In 1945 she served 10 months in the Womens Army Corp (WACs) as a Medical Technician T5.  She completed nurse training at Ft. Benning, GA; served at Foster General Hospital in Jackson, MS and was discharged from Ft. Bragg, NC.  The unit was dissolved at the end of the war.

Grace and Louis lived in Jackson County during and after World War II.  In about 1946 they bought a large, old frame house on Canty St. just south of the Court house complex.  (The house site is now part of the court house parking lot.)  After selling this house in 1966 they moved to the Gautier house on Mary Walker bayou.  In October 1993, Grace moved to Williams St. in Pascagoula to be near her brother Victor and Elnora. 

About 1953 Grace, Louis and her mother became ill with food poisoning.  They had drunk contaminated homemade buttermilk made  using powdered milk, water and a sample of buttermilk.  They were so sick that they were bedridden for about a week. Dr. Weatherford treated them.

She attended Hasting's Business College in Mobile, AL.  She worked as bookkeeper for Weaver Motor Co. in Pascagoula in 1955.  

She attended Beautician's school. On May 18, 1962, she was awarded a diploma for ‘Advanced Hair Designing’ from Sue’s Advanced Designing Institute  in Selma, AL. Beginning in 1962 for about two years she operated a beauty shop, the Exclusive Beauty Shop, in her home on Canty St.  She had two stations in the shop.  Betty Jo Dean said, "Grace could cut hair as good as the best."

Grace joined the Pascagoula chapter of the Eastern Star about 1955.  She served as advisor to the Rainbow Girls for three years from 1957-1960.  Later she was elected secretary of the lodge.  While living in Gautier she worked in the Eastern Star at Vancleave.  She served as Worthy Matron in Vancleave while Havens Fletcher served as Worthy Patron.  

Over the years Grace became an expert seamstress.  She produced professional quality garments.  By using embroidery and finishing details, she enhanced her work.   

On many occasions she decorated the lodge for banquets and special events.  Using sheer table skirts over white cloths she added velvet ropes draped from velvet rosettes.  All these features were handmade.  For years she grew handsome ferns.  These enhanced the decorations.  With fresh flower arrangements she produces beautiful settings for functions.  She decorated several times for state meetings of Eastern Star in Jackson, MS.

In August 1969 Hurricane Camille struck Pass Christian, MS west of Jackson Co.  The high winds combined with heavy rainfall at the high tide swept tidal water up the bayous.  Water climbed up 13" into Grace's house in Gautier.  She and Louis raised up as much furniture as they could.  By remaining there instead of evacuating, they were able to save much of their household goods.  While water was in the house their dachhound Susie lay curled atop an ottoman.  She began barking.  Louis said, "What's wrong with Susie?"  Grace responded, "Hell, she's floating."

In December 1980 Grace hosted a surprise 50th wedding anniversary party for her brother and sister-in-law, Bruce and Lucille Sims.  She personally made all the decorations including favors for guests, and most of the food.  Held at the Masonic Lodge in Pascagoula, it was truly a surprise and a delight to Bruce and Lucille.  About 50 people attended.

After a period of deteriorating health Louis died November 11, 1990.  The Rev. McCormick and Rev. Marvin Dean conducted the burial services.
