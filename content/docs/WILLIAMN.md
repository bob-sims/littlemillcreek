The son of Native American parents, William was probably born in Georgia.  Because the Creek Confederation (or Muskogees) controlled SE Alabama and SW Georgia where they lived, they were probably members of that group.  Barbour Co, AL, where he married, was a part of the Lower Creek nation, specifically the Sawokli tribe.  The map (figure 1) shows the relationships of neighboring tribes.  In 1832 the Sawokli included 2 chiefs and 56 families, according to F. W. Hodge.  William was probably part of one of those families.


His birth date is unclear.  According to the application for his veteran's tombstone, he was born Oct. 16, 1824.  According to the 1900 federal census, he was born Nov. 1829.

The Creeks had a matriarchal society, in which families traced lineage through their mother's family.  The man they called 'father' was their mother's brother.  Both their mother's children and their 'father's' children were their 'brothers' and 'sisters.'

William had a younger sister, Sarah Nixon (b. 1834 ??).  According to family legend, they were orphans.

To persuade the Creeks to cede large tracts of tribal lands in Alabama and Georgia and induce them to emigrate to Oklahoma, the federal government granted individuals allotments of land.  Corruption at several levels prevented Creeks obtaining their 320 acre allotments.  The "Creek Frauds" simmered from 1832 to 1840.  Skirmishes between natives and settlers and land speculators during this period, or the Creek war of 1837, may have killed William and Sarah's parents.  Speculators seized about two million acres of Creek land.

Henry Wilkins, a kindly man, raised William (and Sarah ?) with his family.  Throughout most of his life William lived close to the Wilkins family.  He was grateful for their many kindnesses.

William married Gabriella Parr, another orphan, in Barbour Co. in SE Alabama on 2 September, 1856.  Gabriella (b. April or May 8, 1841?) was the daughter of Samuel and Lusana Humphries Parr.  Both her parents died before 1850.  That year the census records her in Barbour Co. in the household of her stepmother, Elizabeth Parr.

Later in 1856 they moved with the Wilkins family west to Choctaw Co., AL.  They settled near the Mississippi state line.

In February 1862 at Bridgeport, AL, William enlisted in Company G of the 23rd Alabama in the Civil War.  He served as a private under Colonel Beck and Captain Yates.  He fought in a number of battles.  He was captured at the battle of Vicksburg and paroled in a prisoner exchange.  On July 4, 1863, he swore an oath and placed his mark on it not to take up arms "until duly exchanged by the proper authorities."  On November 25, 1863, he was wounded in the right arm and hand at the Battle of Missionary Ridge (a part of the battle of Chattanooga).  On November 28, he was admitted to Floyd House and Ocmulgee Hospitals for his wound.  He remained on sick furlough from December ll to January 9, 1864.  He was with his unit when it surrendered at Citronelle, AL on May 14, 1865.
 
About 1866 they moved, but their place of residence is unknown.

About 1875 they settled in Panola Co., MS.  They remained there the rest of their lives.

The 1880 census lists him as a laborer who cannot read or write.  Gabriella can read and write.  Four of their children remain at home.  Matthew Wilkins, Henry's son, a farmer, aged 50, lives next door.

The federal agricultural census that same year described his farm.  He tilled 45 acres that he rented for a share of the produce.  The farm was valued at $300; his implements at $10; his livestock at $100; his farm production at $100.  His farm included 1 horse and 7 hogs.  During the previous year he paid $10 for farm labor by one colored laborer.  The farm produced 50 dozen eggs, 7 bushels of cow peas, and 45 bushels of sweet potatoes.  He grew 12 acres of corn and harvested 200 bushels.  He grew 15 acres of cotton and made 5 bales.

William had a fine musical voice.  He sang at both the Liberty Hill Baptist Church and Pisgah Methodist Church, according to John Nixon, Jr.   He was known in the family as the "sweet singer".

The personal tax records for Panola Co. for 1890 specify that William owned a horse valued at $50 and a carriage or wagon valued at $5.  For these he paid 22 cents in tax!  He's recorded in Supervisor's District 4 in the Eureka Springs precinct living on J. Morris's land.  W. W. Wilkins lives in the same precinct.

The 1900 census describes him as a farmer who rents his farm.  Only he and Gabriella reside there.  All their children have families of their own.  They live next door to their daughter Sally (age 30) and her husband J. H. Cosby, a farmer, and their family.

August 20, 1900, he applied for a pension as a Civil War veteran.  He states that he has been a resident of Mississippi for 30 years.  He and Gabriella live with J. M. Smith.  He made an "X" for his signature on this form.

Sadly, William died June 6, 1902.  He is buried at Liberty Hill Cemetery 9 miles east of Pope, MS in southern Panola Co.
