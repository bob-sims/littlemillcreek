Sarah Jane was born in 1862 in Choctaw Co, AL.  She was the third child of Harriet Amanda Sims Slaughter and James Slaughter.

Tragically, her dad died about 1863.  In about 1864 her mother married Tom Moseley.

On May 19, 1881, Sarah Jane married W. J. "Charlie" Chadwick (b. Oct. 7, 1859).  (In the marriage records his name was spelled Shadwick.)  He was an exceptional fiddler, close to the best, according to Chester Moseley.

They lived in Waynesboro, MS.

They had two known children:

1. Hickman P. Chadwick (b. 1883; md. Mattie L. McIlwain (b. 1885? or 1895?; worked as a sawyer in a mill; had six known children: 

A. Mattie Chadwick (b. 1904).
B. Ethel Chadwick (b. 1909).
C. Ben Chadwick (b. 1914).
D. Eunista ? Chadwick (a girl, b. 1916).
E. Hickman Perry "Tyte" Chadwick (b. Nov 19, 1919; d. Aug 13, 1951). 
F. Jack Basinger Chadwick (b. July 8, 1927; d. Mar 29, 1929).

2. Celie Chadwick (b. Sept. 22, 1891; d. Mar 28, 1952 in the Central Community outside Waynesboro; md. D. Ben Ross (b. 1891; d. 1988? buried in Silas, AL)); had the following known children.

A. Dan W. Gordon (b. 1909; lived in Silas, AL).
B. David B. Ross (b. 1919; d. before 1952). 
C. Bill Ross (lived in Wayne Co., MS).
D. Sallie B. Ross (md. Randall Rouse (b. 12 Jan 1914; d. 8 May 1986); lived in Petal, MS; no children).
E. Celie Gray Ross (lived in Wayne Co., MS).

On Apr. 3, 1895, Charlie bought 40 acres of land in NW Wayne Co, MS.  However the sale was cancelled.

Sadly, Charlie died on March 29, 1913.  He's buried at the Advent Cemetery three miles NW of Silas in Choctaw Co., AL.  

On 9 Jan 1920, Sarah was listed in the federal census as a farmer  in Choctaw Co., AL.  Two of her grandchildren, Mattie & Ethel Chadwick lived with her.  Her daughter and her husband, Celie and Ben Ross, and their family resided next door.
