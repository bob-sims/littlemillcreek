Born Apr 10, 1883, Camille was the son of Calvin and Elizabeth Mulholland Seymour.  He was born at the Seymour home in Latimer, MS in Jackson Co.

He grew into a tall, handsome man with dark brown hair.  He weighed about 175 lbs.  Unfortunately, like his father, he drank.

Camille married Daisy Caldwell (b. Jan 2, 1888).  She was the daughter of Madison Isaac Caldwell and Orlin Elizabeth Ramsey Caldwell.

They had the following children:

1) Floyd Seymour (b. Mar 31, 1907; he drank until he was cured by the Home of Grace; d. Oct 4, 1973; md. 1)              2)             ).
2) Lorine Seymour (b. May 10, 1911; md. P. Lewis Smith (b. 1901; d. 1988)).
3) Harold Seymour (b. Sept. 11, 1914; d. Oct 16, 1991; md. Tera Yuba Davis (b. Apr. 12, 1914; d. Nov. 14, 1984)).
4) Louise Leanead Seymour (b. Nov. 4, 1915; d. Sept. 26, 1993; md. Andy L. Page (b. Jan 11, 1912; d. Jan 6, 1991)).
5) Jeff Seymour (b. Aug. 17, 1918; d. Oct 4, 1992; md. 1)             2)              ; joined Masonic Lodge).
6) James Seymour (b. Nov. 2, 1922; md. Doris Hargrove (b. Oct. 11, 1923); had 2 boys ?).  
7) Donald Seymour (b. Dec. 19, 1927; never married; d. Feb. 20, 1948; killed in car wreck).

Camille and Daisy also reared their son Jeff and his first wife's son after she left him.

Daisy was very strict with the children.

Camille was a farmer and a trader.  He farmed at the old Seymour place where he was raised.  He would butcher a cow and peddle the meat around the neighborhood.  In the days before refrigeration, meat had to be used the same day it was killed.  

In the 1910 federal census (Apr. 2, 1910) Camille and Daisy with Floyd lived on the farm they owned.

Daisy began to preach at the Latimer Assembly of God church.  Later their son James also preached.

After Camille bought a calf from his uncle, James Scarborough, he teased his daughter May saying, "May, do you want to come help me butcher that cow?"

About 1939 Camille's niece, Inez Havens Sims, was hospitalized for a mastoid operation.  She remained in the Biloxi hospital on the beach for about a week.  Camille visited her several times.    

He bought goats from Victor Sims, his niece's husband, in about 1942.

About 1943 Camille joined the church and stopped drinking.

Sadly, Camille died Mar. 10, 1945.  He's buried at the Seymour cemetery.

Daisy later married Chester Gibson.  

She died at home at 2:30 pm on Apr. 22, 1966 and is buried beside Camille.
