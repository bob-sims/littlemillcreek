Lucille was born March 15, 1912 west of Seminary, MS at Grandpaw Lott's old place to Annie and Wiley Lott.  She was born after Florence, the second of nine children.

Wiley Lott farmed west of Seminary.

At about 12 years of age Lucille broke her arm cranking a Model T car.  It was her Dad's T model touring car with curtains.

The family moved to Seminary about 1925.  Wiley operated a grocery store and restaurant.

For a while the family had a player piano with one song on each roll.  To power it you pumped pedals with both feet.   They had popular tunes such as, "St. Louis Blues", "Beautiful Ohio", and "Darktown Strutter's Ball".  When it was playing that end of town sounded like a circus!

She attended school in Seminary.  She boarded at Perkinston High School the Summer of 1928.  She was graduated from Seminary High School.

Lucille married Bruce Sims on December 14, 1930.  They took a wedding trip to Hattiesburg.

Always slender, in 1932 she became weak and anemic.  Dr. Ross in Hattiesburg diagnosed and treated her for hookworms.  She was cured but never weighed more than 130 lbs.

She worked as a homemaker.  The only time she earned money was years later when she worked at the polling place on election day.  She was a careful housekeeper.  Her home was always neat and clean.  When she finished washing dishes, she always rubbed some Jergens lotion on her hands.

She cooked three meals from scratch every day.  Everyone particularly enjoyed her chicken and dumplings.  She made wonderful pecan pies.

Lucille smoked cigarettes until about 1955 when she quit.  That may have contributed to a benign lung tumor that she developed.

In about 1966 she had the lower lobe of her left lung removed by surgeons at the Sanitorium in Magee, MS.  This facility specialized in treating tuberculosis and lung disorders.  She received excellent care and fully recovered.  She carried a long circular scar from her sternum to her backbone.

Lucille enjoyed sewing and needlework.  Her mother sewed and crocheted.  Lucille had a Singer featherweight portable machine and the table made for it.  She made her own clothes, she mended clothes, and she made garments to give as gifts.  Later Bruce modified a desk that she used for sewing and she bought a Necchi portable machine.   She was a good seamstress. 

She also crocheted and knitted.  She crocheted several colorful wool afgans of granny squares.  She knitted several wool sweaters.

Lucille was a gentle, good-natured, happy person.  When I remember her, I remember her smiling or laughing.  She laughingly told of getting ready to take a shower.  A large walking stick insect was strutting around in the shower stall.  She yelled for Bruce to come get it,  and she said, "all I had on was my earbobs!"

In December 1980 Bruce and Lucille celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.  Her sister-in-law Grace McCaffrey hosted a surprise party to honor them.  The combination of friends, relatives and good food made it a big success.

Bruce died tragically, suddenly the morning of April 27, 1984 of a heart attack.  The day before they had sold their house on Canty St.  He was buried at Machpelah cemetery in the lot with his parents.  

Florence Aultman, her sister, came to stay with Lucille for several weeks.  While they were out walking, Florence fell and broke her leg.  After surgery she was hospitalized as her leg healed.

While still grieving for Bruce, Lucille bought a red-brick house on General Lee St. in Pascagoula and moved.  Ater she got settled she continued to feel poorly.  A doctor diagnosed her as hypothyroid.  Medication helped her.

She cultivated a small vegetable garden.  She grew tomatoes, okra, peppers, peas, butterbeans, mustard and onions.

She pieced quilt tops from small squares of double knit fabric.  These were quilted in the den of her new house.

Over the years she became more and more forgetful.  Later she was diagnosed as having Altheimer's disease.

Lucille had a stroke on Sunday morning March 10, (?) 1990, as she was getting ready to go to church.  Elnora and Grace found her about 1 pm where she had fallen beside the bed.  Dr. McCluskey at Singing River Hospital operated to remove the clot.  He reported that her blood vessels were as fragile as spider webs.   

Mattie Holston cared for her full time in Lucille's home.  While generally healthy, Lucille was often confused.

She suffered a second stroke on May 10, 1990.  Thereafter she could not speak.  After several weeks of hospitalization she was transferred to a nursing home in Denham Springs, LA.  There she was near her sisters, Florence and Bernice Daniels, and nieces.

Lucille died November 19, 1990.  Services were conducted in Pascagoula at O'Bryan-O'Keefe Funeral Home by Rev. Marvin Dean.  Marvin Dean is Lucille's brother-in-law, her sister Betty Jo's husband.  She was buried at Machpelah Cemetery.
