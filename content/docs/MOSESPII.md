Moses was born in Marlboro Co., SC the second son of Moses Pearson Sr. (b. May 21, 1716 ; d. May 25, 1763) and Sarah Rodgers Pearson.  He was born December 31, 1738.

His grandparents were Simon Pearson and Sarah Thurston (daughter of Thomas Thurston of St. Johnâ€™s Parish in Baltimore Co., MD where she was born).

In 1763 he inherited one shilling sterling from his father's estate.  Moses I bequeathed each of his older "beloved" children this token of his regard.  He made more substantial bequests to his younger children.

About 1772 he married Rachel Blair.

They were the parents of 15 children (8 sons and 7 daughters), according to Thomas's History of Marlboro Co.  Their known children included in this approximate order:

1) William Henry Pearson (b. 1775??; d. May 1818; md. Sarah Pledger Steed).
  Thomas Pearson (b. 1777?) (md. ____ _____; had 4 sons & 3 daughters). 
  Margaret "Peggy" Pearson (b. 1780? )(md. Francis Britton (d. Oct 1817)d. 1820).
  Polly Pearson (b. 1784??)
  Joshua J. Pearson (b. 1785? )
  Lamuel Pearson (b. 1787??;d. 1834) (md. Mary David (b. 1790; d. 1856; dau. of John David and Isabella Allison David)).
  Rachel Pearson (b. 1795??)

He and Rachel lived at the Big Plantation (later called Lowden Plantation) on the east side of the PeeDee River.

The family were members of the Cashaway Baptist Church.  In 1789 when the Muddy Creek Baptist Church was established near their home, they participated.  Later it was known as the Brownsville Baptist Church.

Moses fought in the Revolutionary War.  In 1780 he served as a Lieutenant in Hick's Regiment.  In 1781 he advanced to the rank of Captain in Benton's Regiment where he commanded two years.

On 26 Jan 1786 an order was issued to pay Moses for his military service.  He was paid 49 pounds, 10 shillings sterling.

In 1779 his name appeared on a list of jurors for the Cheraws District (that later became a part of Marlboro Co).

He was called for both grand jury and Petit jury duty in 1783.

In 1785 he served with 5 others as tax collectors in St. David's District.  On July 9, 1785, he was appointed (with 3 others) as Overseers of the Poor for 1 year.

That same year with several others Moses worked as a judge in the first court in the county.  They appointed a sheriff and later a deputy sheriff for the county.  They designated the community physician as empowered to bring indictments in the absence of an attorney.  Citizens appeared before these judges to prove and record deeds.  The judges also issued orders for the care of bastard children, and administered punishment for crimes.  They dealt with the crimes of swearing and steer theft among others.  The steer thief received 25 lashes!

Moses received two land grants in both 1785 and again in 1787.  Records have survived for one of these.  On 7 Nov 1785 for 1 pound, 15 shillings and 5 pence sterling he obtained 76 acres.  This tract was an oval-shaped island, Cainy Island, in the PeeDee River.




In the first federal census in 1790 he and his family were listed in the Cheraw District.  The household included Moses & Rachel, 4 sons under 16, 3 daughters and 9 slaves.

For the 1800 federal census Moses was over 45, two sons were 10-16, 2 were 16-26, one daughter Rachel was under 10, Polly was 16-26, Rachel was over 45 and they had 12 slaves.

On October 20, 1800, Moses was declared in default for failing to appear for jury duty.  Failing health probably prevented his participation.

He died on his birthday, December 31, 1800.

His will signed 26 Dec 1799 was probated Dec 1800.  He bequeathed to his wife Rachel a comfortable maintenance from the estate and the negro, Hannah.  Rachel and his beloved friend Col. Thomas Evans and Jesse Vining were designated as executors.

His son, William received 82 acres of land at the lower end of the Big Plantation and all the property William then possessed.  His son Thomas inherited 82 acres, the upper part of the Big Plantation and the negro boy, James.  His son Joshua J. received the lower half of 300 acres where Moses lived (granted to Haskin Newberry), 100 acres granted to Moses on the SE of the above land and one negro boy, Jonah.  His son Lamuel inherited 150 acres, the upper half of the tract granted to Haskin Newberry, where Moses old house and orchard stand, 50 acres joining the lower corner and Henry Hodges and a deep hole in Three Creeks called Lideas hole and a piece over the creek called Glory Hill where Daniel Evans kept school and one negro boy, Demsey.

His daughter, Peggy Britton, received a negro girl, Patt, one cow & calf and two sows and pigs.  His daughter Polly Pearson inherited 50 acres of land where Chesdy Handly lived (granted to Wm. Swett) and a negro girl, Mary.

Joshua, Lamuel, Peggy, Polly and daughter Rachel equally divided all other property, lands, negros (not before mentioned), cattle, hogs, sheep, horses and plantation tools.
