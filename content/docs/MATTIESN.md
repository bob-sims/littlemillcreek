Mattie was born in 1886 in Choctaw Co., AL the daughter of James Sims (b. 1850) and Nancy Elizabeth "Betty" Bazoon Sims (b. Nov 15, 1862; d. Nov 7, 1943; daughter of William and Francis Bazoon).  Mattie's parents were married April 5, 1882.

Later Betty Lighthall recalled her grandmother, Betty Sims, as of average height and weight with her white hair fashioned into a bun.  She made quilts and tended a beautiful vegetable garden.  She was a wonderful person who enjoyed giving away vegetables from her garden.  The neighbors kindly referred to her as "Miss Betty".

Mattie had an older sister, Rena Sims (b. Nov 1883) and a younger brother, Tolstoi ("Tolly") Sims (b. May 1889).

After her father's death in 1891, on Nov 8, 1895 her mother married Sam O. Rogers (b. Mar 29, 1874; d. Oct 2, 1959).  The ceremony was performed at her home.  Betty and Sam had two children: Sada O. (b. Mar 1896; md. Floyd Wallaker; no children), her half-sister, and Boyer Earl (b. Oct 1897; md. Verna _____; had 7 children), her half-brother. 

About 1901 Mattie married David Perry Nordan (b. Dec 7, 1877; son of ______ (d. before 1917) and George W. Nordan (d. 1926)).  Physically he was a big man.  In the 1900 federal census Perry was described as a teamster.  

They lived their entire lives near Gilbertown in Choctaw County.  Their home was about one half mile from the center of Gilbertown.

Later Sam began to sell her father's land (about 1000 acres).  Mattie refused to sign papers relinquishing her interest in mineral rights in the land.  

Mattie and Perry had the following children:

1) Ruby Nordan (b. Aug 25, 1902; md.1) ______ Schribner, 2) ______ Blue).

Early in 1923 Mattie became a devout Christian and joined the Seventh Day Adventist Church.  According to her granddaughter Jesse Cooper, she would sit in a rocker or swing on the porch with a pencil and paper and her Bible.  She frequently recorded what happened on paper, a fine habit.

Sadly, her tenth child Lynn was born with clubbed feet.  She grieved, fearful that he would never be able to walk.  Then she began to pray.  Ultimately, a Dr. Barres from Texas came to their house, made shoes with braces and operated on Lynn.  After healing, the boy was able to walk normally.  

Then in 1926 when Bernice was born she had one clubbed foot and one slightly bent foot.  The doctor that delivered her put tape on her best foot and it straightened.  After unsuccessful effort and fervent prayer, she was treated by Dr. Hannon in a hospital in Mobile, AL.  The family has Mattie's 8 page record, written about 1932 of these events, a treasure.  It appears below with her original spelling.



Lynn was borned club footed in both feet.  Fine baby he was and the night after being borned I happened to feel of his little feet and found that they were clubed.  Oh how hurt I was.  They had not told me about it as the Dr. thought best not to let me know untill I felt better.  It was then that I was in my first love for Jesus.  Had joined the Church a few months before this.  And my first thought was to take it to the Lord in prayer.  I had never seen are herd of such a case like that before.  Oh I just thought that my baby could never walk.  So I prayed a cried to the Lord to help us in some way to get our baby feet straight.  So it wasnt long until here came a ad from my sister Rena that she had cut out of paper telling of the great work they were doing for cripple children in Shreveport.  So I wrote Rena to know if she could go with me.  She said yes.  So we made plans to go and I took Lynn and got as far as Hattiesburg on my way.  Got over there and Oliver had talked to a Dr. there about the child and he said yes he had had a little experience in that line of work and he thought he could straighten them rite out.  Well that sounded good that it could be done over there.  And I could stay with my sister, and not go on any futher.  So we carried the child down to hospital that evening.  The Dr. had nurse to baith feet and bind them up.  And were to have him back at 8 oclock next morning for operation so that we had him dressed for operation.  He seemed to be well and hearty 8 months old.  The Dr. came in dressed ready and he took the baby played with him.  He was sweet & laughing.  The Dr. said you are a fine little boy.  Dont think you are sick but better take your tempeture.  I never operate without it.  He took it.  And said well to my suprise his tempeture is 102.  Said who would have thought it bright as he is.  So he said couldnt operate with tempeture.  He said take him home give him chill tonic a few days and bring him back.  Well I stayed a week with Rena & Oliver, but the baby never seemed to be sick in the least.  But I give the chill tonic any way and we carried him back one evening.  The Dr. said sure he is allrite this time.  They bound up his little feet again.  Next morning we had him back for operation again.  The nurse took him dressed him for operation.  The Dr. came in again played with him and said surely he has no tempeture.  But told the nurse to take it.  She did and he had more than he did before.  Then said better take him home and wait untill Spring and bring him back.  Said maby he is taking cold and hasnt showed up on him yet that causes the tempeture.  I thought to my that you are not the one to do the work, for I had prayed so hard for the Lord not to let the rong Dr. handle him.  I brought him home.  Then wrote to the Shreveport Dr.  He wrote back he would be glad to take the case but was full up write then, but would soon give me a date when to carry him.  But if the child had cold are tempeture in 2 days of the time to cary him, to not carry him, but notify him and he would give me another date.  So at the time we were to go the baby took such high fever he was having spasms so that was all off again.  And I had prayed that I could stay with the child whereever the work was done.  So I thought well that is not the place for him eather.  So I droped that.  Then here came add from my cousin Lillie Bonner.  There was a Dr. in Texas that was highly recomended for cripple children.  Then I ans. to the ad.  It said he could straighten them at home.  That suited Perry & Me to have the child at home.  Lynn was about two years old then and I never could here from this Dr. for 6 are 7 months.  I thought would never here, but one day a car rolled up.  A man Dr. Barres came in.  He stoped on the steps, ask for Mrs. Nordon, as Perry had met him.  Them Perry called me.  I came out.  Dr. said here is a letter.  See if you know the hand write.  Then you will know who I am.  I took the letter and saw my name on the corner and Dr. Barres adress.  I said yes I wrote that.  He said yes, guess you think it strange for me to came in ans. to your letter.  I said yes, didnt think you would ever ans. as it had been so long.  He said I want to see the child.  I called him.  He could hop, but not walk.  Dr. said yes that a pesty case.  Then he had a bunch of letters from other people who children he had straightened.  Perry and I read them.  Then he wanted to know if we wanted him to straighten Lynn feet.  Well that was hard to say.  We wanted the work done, but we didnt know what to do.  So Dr. said to Perry, get me a little table and I will make him a pair of shoes and just show you how it is done.  Of course he got one.  He maid the shoes with braces on.  Then ask for a pan of warm watter and gave the child some condie tablets to eat.  Ask me to hold the child and let him show me how it was done.  Had Perry holding one foot and he took his lancers knife are something and cut his heel strings into, but had baithed them in eather are something before cutting.  Then put bandage and shoes on.  Then gave him tablets to make him rest that night.  He cried but very little, but was fretful for a few days.  Had to weare the shoes and braces for about a year.  But began to walk in 3 weeks after putting on the shoes with braces.  But his little feet straightened rite up.  Dr. left next day after the operation.  Had to pay him $150.00.  So we were proud of his feet and I'm sure the Lord sent him in ans. to my prayers for his feet was straightened rite here at home.  And if he had of ans. my letter no dout what we would have bin afraid to let him do the work.  And as it was he did it without our concent, and it worked out fine.  Of course I had to be writting to the Dr. all along letting him know how he was getting along.

Then in the main time, little Bernice was borned club footed to.  While one foot was not so bad.  The Dr. that waited on me put strong heasive tape on it and in a few days it was allrite.  But the other foot was real bad.  Of coarce we was worried about her to, but didn't take just like I did Lynn, for I knew that man had straightened his feet and could straighten hers.  So I didnt pray so hard for her as I should have.  I was depending on man more than God.  So this old Dr. came back to see about taking braces off of Lynn.  Bernice was 5 are 6 months old and so we got him to operate on her foot, but she was to young.  She would kick the shoe with brace on clear off of her foot with her straight foot and cried a lot.  And we could not keep it on her.  So I wrote the Dr.  He came back and maid her another shoe.  He said she couldnt kick it off, but she did.  She kicked them off untill her little heel was skint.  So her foot growed back croocked.  I kept writting to the Dr. couldnt here from him at all.  I registerd him a letter.  Then his wife wrote that the Dr. had passed away was the reason he didnt come back and finish the job.  So after Bernice could walk, we put the shoes with braces on and kept them on for about 3 years, but didn't do any good.  So I was so dishardened over it.  I said it was all my fault because I hadn't prayed so hard for her as I did Lynn, that I depended on man in place of God to straighten her feet and had been a failure.  So I went to praying for her day & night .  Oh how worried I was.  At last a letter came to me from Verna,  while they lived up at Bates. with add in it that she had clipped out of paper saying there would be a free clinic at Demopolis at a certain date for cripple children.  So we decided to carry Bernice up there.  Well the Dr. looked at her and said it could be straightened okey, but she had sores all on her legs.  So he advised us to bring her home and give medicine to purify her blood, and let the supervisor know and he would have a room for her and for us to talk to him and he would tell us all about it.  So we went out and talked to him.  He said he would have a room for her in Selma and for us to write him when she got over the sores.  Then we ask the costs and he said $200 besides my board while there.  Well Perry didnt make much money, so we tried to get it down.  But no, he wouldnt knock it off so we got her well and ready for operation and I wrote the supervisor.  Told him that she was allrite and would be glad to have the work done and that we had a big family and that my husband salry was small and we didnt see how we could pay the 200 and ask him to do better for us if possible.  Well he was like Lynn Dr. didnt ans. for several months.  I just thought he was not going to ans.  I was so worried.

So one day I was studing my Sabbath school lesson and it happened to be on prayer, so many promises in ans. to prayer.  Oh my heart was touched.  I said Lord you have promised to here our prayers.  I believe you will.  I got up laid my Bible down.  Went into my closet.  There I passed out my heart to God untill wet with perspiration and ask God to let me here from that Supervisor before the week was gone if that was the rite Dr. to handle the case for my heart was so burdened.  The child was about old enough to go to school and couldnt weare shoes woith nothing, just hopped along.  I stayed on my knees untill I knew the Lord was closte to me.  It seemed that I could feel him so clost to me that I could reach out and draw him clost to me.  When I got up from prayer I was sure I would here from the supervisor soon.  This was Monday evening late.  Then on Wednesday a car stoped.  I went out.  A man came walking in & said is this Mrs. Nordan.  I said yes.  He said do you remember me.  I said yes, you are the one we talked to in Demopolis at the free clinic.  He said yes.  My heart was overflowing, because I knew it was in ans. to prayer that he had come.  He said guess you think it strange way to ans. your letter to come after waiting so long.  But reaily I just overlooked the letter and forgot it. I sorry to say, I should not have been so carless, but yesterday I happened to come across your letter and I said then that I would come and see about the child.  Have you had anything done for her.  I said no.  He said I would like to see her.  I called her.  She came hopping out one shoe on one off.  He picked her up said what a sweet little girl you are to be crippled and we are going to make arangements to have this foot crected.  Then he said I wonder if you have relitives in Selma that you could stay with, so you could visit her each day.  I said no I dont even know any one there.  Then he said how about Mobile.  I said yes I have some relitives there.  He said well we have a fine Dr. bone specilest Dr. Hannon there and we will take you down there.  I said that sounds good.  He said I will let you know as soon as we have a vacan room for her.  I said allrite but how about the cost.  He said we will not make you any price.  The child is what we are intrested in and you can pay what you are able to pay.  Do you think you could pay $50.  I said yes, if you will give us a little time.  He said good.  We will give you as long as you want.

So I took her to hospital and the Lord was good.  Her foot was straightened.  And it makes me strong in the Lord for I know he ans. my prayers.  Both came in ans. to my letters in place of writting.  How thankful I am for this experience.

Mrs. D. P. Nordan       




Sadly, just after Christmas in either 1922 or 1923 the family's home burned down.  It happened on a Saturday when the family was at church.  They rushed home but the house was a total loss.  Their daughter Betty had gotten her first doll that Christmas from Santa Claus.  The doll perished with everything else.

Initially they lived in a nearby vacant house.  Neighbors and friends generously gave them some furniture and household goods.  Perry built a six room house across the road from the original house site.  That became the family's final home.

After his father's death in March 1926, Perry served as administrator of his estate.

For many years Perry drove the school bus in Silas, AL.

After the oil discovery at Gilbertown, in Choctaw Co. in 1944, Mattie received royalties from oil for her interest in the land.  She was the only one in the family to benefit from the oil money.

In about 1945 she and Perry drove to Moselle, MS in a brand new Chevrolet car to visit Iggie and Solie Sims.  At that time she weighed about 200 lbs.  She was jovial and out-going.

Sadly, her husband Perry died March 16, 1946.  He's buried at the Paragon Cemetery in Choctaw Co., AL.

After a rich life in 1976 Mattie died, aged 90!  She's buried beside Perry.
