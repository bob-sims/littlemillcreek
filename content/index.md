ï»¿This effort attempts to record vital statistics wrapped in memories to make folks interesting.  Each biography presents a summary of a life adventure.  Those of us related to these fine people take strength from them, because they are Who We Are.

My extraordinary father, Victor Sims, provided most of the memories.  Born in 1908, his memory in 1997 at age 89 was simply astonishing.  As a man of the highest integrity, his recall is completely free of deception or falsehood.

It is a big challenge to capture someone's spirit on paper.  Because humans are complex creatures, these word portraits are unfortunately, only fragments from sometimes astonishing, sometimes ordinary lives.  Whenever possible anecdotes or quotes from the person are included.  These reveal both personality and character.  Throughout, at the risk of offending folks, my descriptions are forthright and direct.  If someone drank too much, I record that. 

In genealogy, recent subjects and recent events can more easily be discovered and documented than older subjects and events.  Thus the possibility of errors increases with early material.  Some relationships and dates are based on conjecture.  They are probable, but not proven. 

My assumptions include the following:  

1. Two families with the same last name residing side by side are related.
2. If a parent is missing in the census record of a family, that adult has died.

Whenever possible original or primary source materials have been consulted.  While I was fortunate to be able to work at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, the Federal Archives in Washington, DC and the state Archives in MS, AL, GA, NC and SC, there was never enough time.

Do not assume that any material in print is valid.  Because the census records include errors and because we are all human, this effort includes unknown errors.  I welcome all corrections and contributions to make this more accurate.

Certain abbreviations, now fairly general, have been used throughout.

- `b.`   born
- `d.`   died
- `md.`  married
- `?`   about; needs confirmation.
- `??`   an approximation.

The biographies are presented in alphabetical order of surname. Names in one account that are featured in another are marked with (Bio #) after their name.
 
Copies of this work have been donated to libraries in several states.  I hope that all who can discover relatives here will have access to a copy.

This work is dedicated to those who love those portrayed.
